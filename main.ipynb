Watch the memory\\n\\n\\nDialogue\\\\[]\\n-----------\\n\\n\\n### Talk to Aventurine\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Mission Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nYou have witnessed the truth that can \"result in the collapse of Penacony\" as mentioned by Aventurine... Robin\\'s body starts to disintegrate from the crack in her chest and is eventually reduced to nothingness in the dream.  \\nAventurine seems to have something to say. Let\\'s see what he has got up his sleeves. The Reverie (Dreamscape)\\n\\n(Talk to Aventurine)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Ah, friend. My expression wasn\\'t much better than yours when I first saw this.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Your eyes aren\\'t deceiving you — it\\'s her, the famous singer Robin.\\n But... how is that possible?\\n Could Robin actually...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** First of all, can I just say that this had nothing to do with me. I\\'m just an unlucky bystander here. The Family can testify for me. If you don\\'t believe me, just ask anyone in the Bloodhound Family — they hate me, and they hate the IPC, so they\\'d never lie.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** This is not where the crime happened. What I showed to you was a \"memory\" — the most basic Light Cone manifesting tech, authorized by the Garden of Recollection and owned by the IPC.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Did you really think the Galaxy Ranger was an outsider this whole time?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Penacony has made a solemn commitment to protect the safety of anyone inside a Family dream. Any person in distress will be forcibly awakened and safely returned to reality.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** What gives them the confidence to make such conclusive statements? Because behind this promise is the Harmony: The Family\\'s Dreamweavers link up their minds together to construct an unbreakable defensive line.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Breaking through this line of defense to create \"Death\" in the dreamscape... Not even a Memokeeper could do that without The Family\\'s permission.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Who could have done it? Friend, the only one is her, the girl who calls herself a Galaxy Ranger... An imposter, an unsought guest, an Emanator who hides her true identity...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Ifrit\\'s death was a foregone conclusion, and Robin... her misfortune was staring right at her. Who will be the next to die?\\n This really is... hard to take in.\\n That\\'s just one side of the story.\\n If that\\'s the case, I can\\'t trust anyone.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** It\\'s fine. Listen to your gut. Building trust always takes time, and I\\'m willing to wait.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I just hope you realize that wherever that legacy is concerned... covert plans are already underway throughout Penacony. Everyone\\'s got their own agenda.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Careful you don\\'t get stuck on the wrong side. If I were you, I\\'d keep my distance from Acheron. After all, any schemes out in the open are always going to be better than a monster in the shadows... right?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Who\\'s to say there isn\\'t an even deeper conspiracy lurking beneath the surface?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Memokeeper, I think our little deal is finished.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Aventurine is telling the truth. This \"memory\" is a real one, and there\\'s no sign of any distortion grafting on.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** The IPC is not the Garden, and there are real limits to what they can actually do. But you know all this.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Friend, let\\'s not beat around the bush here — the thing is, I want to reach out personally to team up with the Astral Express.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I told you, I\\'m just not interested in scrambling for \"the Legacy.\" I just came to Penacony for work. I\\'m here to retrieve some lost property for the IPC, if you catch my drift... I\\'m talking ownership of this \"frontier prison.\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** This has all become a bad debt thanks to the Cancer of All WorldsStellaron. The IPC has tried sitting down for negotiations time and again, but The Family wouldn\\'t even take our calls.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** You have no idea how difficult these people are to deal with. Put it this way — they\\'ve hushed up the existence of \"Death\" before, so they can definitely cover up any news about Robin\\'s death.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** It\\'ll just quietly float off like a bubble and pop, nobody ever being the wiser...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** That\\'s not fair, right? So then, friend, I need your help.\\n What kind of help?\\n I\\'ve got something on right now.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** That\\'s fine. I\\'m not forcing you.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** But I\\'m really not asking for much, so why don\\'t you at least hear me out, okay?\\n I can\\'t trust you.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** That\\'s fine. I\\'m not forcing you.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** But I\\'m really not asking for much, so why don\\'t you at least hear me out, okay?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I have but only one goal: The Family\\'s front door is like a high wall, and to tear the whole thing down I\\'ll have to dig out a few chunks first. Once I find a weak point, the IPC will have plenty of means.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Now we have our chance. So long as we can get to the truth behind her death, we can have justice for Robin while also gaining a valuable bargaining chip for bringing The Family to the table.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Truly a once\\\\-in\\\\-a\\\\-blue\\\\-moon opportunity... I\\'ve been investigating and making lots of friends all over Penacony precisely for this very moment.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** This tragic news would be extremely bad for The Family, so they\\'ll be doing everything they can to stop it leaking — especially to the IPC.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** But I trust there are still a few factions that remain exceptions, and that\\'s why I need you all. The reputation of the Astral Express precedes you, and the Harmony will give you the fairest of appraisals.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** You get to find out really what happened and seek justice, and I get to put it toward completing my mission for the IPC... It\\'s what you call a win\\\\-win situation.\\n You want to take advantage of The Family\\'s trust in us?\\n The Nameless would never associate with the IPC.\\n A decision like this is way above my pay grade...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Don\\'t worry. Just head back and talk things over with your companions.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** That navigator is really smart. She must understand the value of this deal. Look, here\\'s my contact details. If you come to any conclusions, call me.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Oh, and... take this! A thorough investigation can always use a little more funding. Don\\'t mention it!\\n▶ **Aventurine:** So long, friend. I really am looking forward to uncovering the truth about \"Death\" with everyone.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (Aventurine just sauntered off... He really doesn\\'t mean to force it, but something still seems off...)\\n▶ **Black Swan:** ...What now? What are your plans?\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (Black Swan... What is she thinking?)\\n(Obtain  Credit ×50,000)\\n\\n### Speak with Black Swan\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nUsing Robin\\'s death as an excuse, Aventurine invites you to collaborate with him in bringing down The Family. It is not coercion, but a temptation with the promise of gain. Although he leaves you with enough room to decide, you know that one should not be hasty when it comes to decision\\\\-making.  \\nYou still have the chance to talk to Black Swan and ask for her advice before leaving the Memory Zone. The Reverie (Dreamscape)\\n\\n(Talk to Black Swan)\\n▶ **Black Swan:** On the surface, this doesn\\'t look like a bad deal for you. But Aventurine is a shrewd merchant whose scheme won\\'t just be as simple as it appears to be.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** He doesn\\'t know about Miss Firefly yet — but judging by your reaction, he may have noticed something going on and deliberately shifted topics to the \"Truth of Death\" to try and pull you in line with his way of thinking.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** That\\'s quick thinking, and very sound logic. Aventurine is no fool. And working with him definitely has its dangers.\\n The Nameless cannot turn a blind eye to evil.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** But you\\'re talking about REAL evil.\\n For Firefly\\'s sake, we must get to the bottom of all this.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** That... is something I agree on.\\n Playing it safe seems to be the smarter move.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Insofar as things are presently concerned, yes. But what about the long\\\\-term?\\n Can I toss a die to let it decide for me?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Leaving it up to fate? It\\'s just how that gambler thinks.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Anyway, be careful out there. There\\'s more than one way to blaze a trail. In a dark forest beset by wolves ensuring your own escape to safety should be your primary concern.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** As for the other questions...\\n Did \"Death\" kill Robin?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** I\\'m not sure the two cases were committed by the same culprit, but that massive wound... looked like its winged blade. We\\'ve all witnessed it in action before.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Plus... it seems unlikely that there would be two lethal entities loose in the dreamscape.\\n Do you think this is connected to Acheron?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Sorry, I can\\'t answer that question. That ranger is shrouded in mystery. I\\'m afraid no one is capable of providing an answer.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** But without a doubt... she is the most \"special\" guest at this banquet. It\\'s like Aventurine said just then. It\\'s best to keep your distance from her.\\n Have you noticed anything else unusual?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Two victims appearing one after the other in a very short time span... In and of itself, that\\'s very unusual.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Two possibilities: The collapse of Penacony\\'s Dreamscape has started speeding up, making \"Death\" extremely agitated and weakening The Family\\'s protections. Or, everything has been planned out and executed by someone.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** If someone has chosen these victims deliberately... First a **stowaway**, then a **Family celebrity**... Then this murderer\\'s motives are worth thoroughly chewing over.\\n I don\\'t have any other questions.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** It\\'s all happened so quickly I can only make conjecture. After leaving here, go have a chat with your companions. I hope you can clarify the source of this confusion.\\n**Black Swan leads you through the chaotic Dreamscape...**\\n\\n### Follow Black Swan out of the hotel\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nBlack Swan answers your questions and promises to escort you to the exit of the Memory Zone. Hopefully, she isn\\'t up to any mischief this time... Or, do you secretly enjoy the little tricks she pulls? The Reverie (Dreamscape)\\n\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Come, this way — it\\'s a short walk. Don\\'t get lost.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Approach Black Swan)\\n▶ **Black Swan:** This way... This is where we part ways. All of this is like... a nightmare.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Unfortunately, the Remembrance doesn\\'t lie... What we just saw is the \"reality\" that happened — and it won\\'t fade from our minds just because we wake up.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** But follow your heart and don\\'t be afraid. We all walk through this world casting shadows of different lengths, and ultimately... all we leave behind are precious memories.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** ...Ah, hold on just a sec.\\n**Black Swan gently touches the root of your ear, leaving a cool sensation. Then, she hands a card over to you.**\\n▶ **Black Swan:** There you go, a small parting gift. If one day, you unfortunately fall into the deep waters of the Memory Zone and there\\'s no Memokeeper to join you — hopefully it can guide you on my behalf.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** I also pay great attention to the ways of the world... Just think of this as an apology from me for hiding something from you.\\n Thank you.\\n That\\'s it?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Then... I\\'ve something private to take care of regarding that Galaxy Ranger. Let\\'s leave things there, shall we?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** What fascinating memories will you bring for me next time we meet...? I sincerely look forward to them.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nMessages  \\nThe Astral Express FamilyMarch 7th(Trailblazer)You still at hotel in the dreamscape?(Trailblazer)(Trailblazer)WeltHave you run into trouble?HimekoWe got separated in the Memory Zone, but (Trailblazer) is with the MemokeeperMarch 7thI feel so antsyHelpHimekoMarch, stay calmDan HengDo I need to get off the Express and help?HimekoNot at the momentDan HengSure.

The Reverie (Dreamscape)\\n\\n**Some time ago — Deep in Memory Zone**\\n(Cutscene plays)\\n\\n**Sam:** Better unsheathe that blade now.\\n**Sam:** Ranger.\\n**Acheron:** ...Do you still dream, hunter\\n**Acheron:** of those slain by your hand?\\n(Cutscene ends)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n**Days ago — Ever\\\\-Flame Mansion**\\nMedia:Trailblaze Mission The Devil in Velvet.mp4   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n▶ **Duke Inferno:** ...\\n▶ **Duke Inferno:** ...It appears the outcome has already been determined.\\n▶ **Acheron:** They\\'re still alive, as are you.\\n▶ **Acheron:** You still have room to make a choice. Leave the music box behind, and then go.\\n▶ **Duke Inferno:** Choice? The bloody trail of the Destruction leaves no room for hesitation.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Fetora\\'s fire demon... Even if you sacrifice your life for that Aeon, you won\\'t get special treatment.\\n▶ **Duke Inferno:** Ranger, you tread the narrow Path of The Hunt. You could never understand.\\n▶ **Duke Inferno:** We come from the fire, and are born bathed in fire. We spread, burn, and destroy until all the kindling has burned out, and we leave only ashes on the ground.\\n▶ **Duke Inferno:** Burning forms the entire life of a fire demon, from the beginning to the end. We are born to die, just to put into practice a profile of another universal truth: All things are created for the Destruction.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Your companions don\\'t seem to think so. They fight for your chance at survival.\\n▶ **Duke Inferno:** They are my children and, just as I was, they are flames that have yet to burn white\\\\-hot. They\\'re still young and I don\\'t blame them.\\n▶ **Duke Inferno:** But my flames are faint and time is running out. Can you see the Planet of Festivities in the distance? I plan to bring purgatory with me there — and before that, I must surpass you.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Why?\\n▶ **Duke Inferno:** Because on the path THEY have forged, you have traveled farther than I have...\\n▶ **Duke Inferno:** ...\"Emanator.\"\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...\\n▶ **Duke Inferno:** You cannot hide your true identity. Draw that sword, for we shall indeed remain here, bound to fight a decisive battle to the death, for I **choose** this.\\n▶ **Duke Inferno:** Destruction is intense but brief. To cravenly cling to life is to endure an endlessly prolonged existence.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Even if the answer... turns out to be your own destruction?\\n▶ **Duke Inferno:** What\\'s important is not the answer, but that it exists — just as you exist. Everything exists to be destroyed — Emanators are no different.\\n▶ **Duke Inferno:** Just as even sweet dreamsPenacony may be born of the void, the so\\\\-called impossible is merely something that has yet to happen.\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...Alright. I accept.\\n▶ **Duke Inferno:** You shall witness the most brilliant and intense fire in existence. May this flame illuminate the farthest reaches of your bottomless dream.\\n▶ **Acheron:** A bottomless dream... Yes, that\\'s right. But you\\'ve made one small mistake.\\n▶ **Acheron:** This blade remains in its scabbard not out of pity or scorn. It\\'s a personal secret that I don\\'t want to disclose, but perhaps out of reciprocity...\\nShe says this as her hand gently rests on the hilt of the sword.\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...I\\'ll reveal the truth to you.\\n▶ **Acheron:** The Hunt... is not the path I truly follow.\\n...\\n▶ **Acheron:** May death be the end of your boundless dream...\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...guiding you back to the waking world.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Cutscene plays)\\n\\n**Acheron:** ...I still see them in my dreams.\\n**Acheron:** Hold it. Your time hasn\\'t come yet.\\n(Cutscene ends)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Sam:** ...\"My time\"?\\n▶ **Acheron:** I\\'ve seen many clever disguises that can conceal appearances, but they can never cover up who a person really is. And you\\'re no different.\\n▶ ▶ **Acheron:** You had no desire to kill (Trailblazer). You only did what you did to drive me and the Memokeeper away... but why?\\n▶ **Sam:** ...\\n▶ **Acheron:** Did Destiny\\'s Slave make you do it?\\n▶ **Sam:** You know Elio.\\n▶ **Acheron:** I thought this is just the kind of thing that\\'d get written into your \"script.\"\\n▶ **Sam:** My \"script\" has always been brief. Other than that. Anything beyond that is unnecessary.\\n▶ **Sam:** He knows my nature: There is but a single destiny, from which no one can escape... And until then, I hold the privilege of choice.\\n▶ **Sam:** However, you appear to be ignorant of this, so it\\'s time for me to inquire: Who exactly are you?\\n▶ **Acheron:** Not your enemy, perhaps.\\n▶ **Sam:** That\\'s not what I asked.\\n▶ **Acheron:** I don\\'t deserve your curiosity. Loners wandering the cosmos always have their secrets. Take me. I\\'ve also been wanted by the IPC, so it\\'s little wonder I know something about the Stellaron Hunters... that\\'s all.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Maybe I can help.\\n▶ **Sam:** What reason would you have for doing that?\\n▶ **Acheron:** I tend to forget things — which is why, rather than memories, I\\'m accustomed to using my emotions to capture what I normally wouldn\\'t otherwise. So...\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...I know who is inside that cold armor.\\n▶ **Sam:** ...\\n▶ **Acheron:** How about it? Ready to take off that armor and sit down for a talk?\\n▶ **Sam:** It\\'s not yet time.\\n▶ **Sam:** I don\\'t need help, but I can give you a suggestion that would make things better for you and me.\\n▶ **Sam:** If your goal is the Watchmaker\\'s Legacy, then go look into The Family. Not only are they covering up the existence of \"Death,\" but they\\'re burying the past and the truth about what happens inside the Dreamscape.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Already on it.\\n▶ **Sam:** ...and the Astral Express is no enemy of yours.\\n▶ **Acheron:** I know that... I just never expected to hear you say it.\\n▶ ▶ **Acheron:** What\\'s next, then? (Trailblazer)\\'s been taken by Black Swan. Will you go look for (him/her)?\\n▶ **Sam:** No need for that... No harm in mentioning that Elio\\'s only given me one instruction: \"Get all of the Astral Express to track down the grand legacy.\"\\n▶ **Sam:** I tried settling this in an easier and more direct way, but as you can see, here I am, confronting you: I failed. Can\\'t ever go against \"the script.\"\\n▶ **Acheron:** \"The so\\\\-called impossible is merely something that has yet to happen\"...\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...That\\'s it. Before we split, can I ask you one more thing?\\n▶ **Acheron:** Is there anything else in your \"script\" about me? I\\'d like to know what kind of footnote \"I\" get to leave in that future foreseen by destiny?\\n▶ **Sam:** Unfortunately, not a thing came up.\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...I knew it.\\n▶ **Sam:** Hang on...\\n▶ **Sam:** I don\\'t.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Don\\'t what?\\n▶ **Sam:** Your first question was: \"Do you still have dreams about everyone who died because of you?\"\\n▶ **Sam:** I don\\'t. Never have.\\n▶ **Sam:** I was born without the ability to \"dream.\" I live for this cold harsh reality, for a little light, and to burn... to keep on burning, until I turn to ash.\\n▶ **Sam:** So, I really envy you.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Is that so...\\n▶ **Acheron:** Then you\\'re already living in the waking world.\\n\\nTrivia\\\\[]\\n---------\\n\\n\\n* The name of this mission is a reference to John Dickson Carr\\'s *The Devil in Velvet*.\\n\\n\\nGallery\\\\[]\\n----------\\n\\n\\nTrailblaze Mission The Devil in Velvet \\\\- Acheron vs SamTrailblaze Mission The Devil in Velvet \\\\- Acheron\\'s Decision\\nOther Languages\\\\[]\\n------------------\\n\\n\\n\\nChange History\\\\[]\\n-----------------\\n\\n\\nReleased in **Version 2\\\\.1**\\\\[Create New History]\\nNavigation\\\\[]\\n-------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n']\n",

After an intense discussion, you decide to work with Aventurine. Before planning the next step, take some time to discuss what everyone is concerned about. Golden Hour\\n\\n**Present day — Golden Hour**\\n▶ **March 7th:** We heard about Miss Firefly from Black Swan... But we never expected Miss Robin to...\\n▶ **Himeko:** I\\'m sorry... that I couldn\\'t be with you then.\\n▶ **Welt:** Reality cruises on in serenity, while undercurrents bubble up from the Dreamscape... just like that Memokeeper said...\\n▶ **Welt:** ...Stay strong, everyone. We can still do what we can for them... starting with finding the murderer.\\n▶ ▶ **Himeko:** Let\\'s recap everything then. (Trailblazer) just reminded me of something: March, do you remember what that Family rep who negotiated with us said?\\n▶ **March 7th:** \"Indeed, we trust that the Nameless has nothing to do with this, and we also beg each of you to help assist The Family in verifying the identity of the deceased.\" That\\'s how it was put... in reference to Miss Firefly.\\n▶ **Himeko:** Looking back, he seemed a little evasive at the time. And he also failed to mention anything about the earlier murder, too.\\n▶ **March 7th:** The Family is planning on covering up all news about Miss Robin\\'s death. If news gets out, Penacony is going to turn into a bloodbath...\\n▶ **Welt:** But the murder that followed closely after was obviously beyond their anticipation. The Family had to try and turn things to their advantage by bringing in reinforcements from outside. The Charmony Festival is nearly here — they must be snowed under.\\n▶ **Himeko:** It may also be that Miss Firefly\\'s murder had so many witnesses that it couldn\\'t be covered up, so they went with the flow and let more people on the scene to control the situation.\\n▶ **Himeko:** After all, the nature of the two murders is fundamentally different... The Family\\'s first protective measures should be against malicious actors among the guests, such as that IPC envoy.\\n He really is up to no good.\\n▶ **Welt:** All the while accusing that Galaxy Ranger...\\n Aventurine is on guard against Acheron.\\n▶ **Welt:** Indeed, he was particularly concerned about that Galaxy Ranger.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Are we missing the forest for the trees here...? I always felt that Aventurine\\'s reasons for accusing Miss Acheron were highly subtle. Can we believe him?\\n▶ **Himeko:** At this point, I\\'m afraid the only ones we can trust are ourselves.\\n▶ **Welt:** Look, let\\'s try to gather intel first and then list all the possible outcomes we can. Then we go through them, eliminating contradictions one\\\\-by\\\\-one. The fewer facts remaining, the closer we are to the truth.\\n▶ **Welt:** ...I\\'ve still got this sense of foreboding. It\\'s like we\\'re stuck in a whirlpool — spinning around that Legacy even after everything that\\'s happened...\\n▶ **March 7th:** This time we\\'re playing the role of a real detective... But before we start, what are we going to say to The Family and Aventurine?\\n▶ **Himeko:** As I see things, The Family harbors no ill\\\\-will towards the Astral Express — if they didn\\'t trust the Crew, they wouldn\\'t have casually commissioned outsiders to investigate a case that\\'s in all likelihood \"a scandal.\"\\n▶ **Himeko:** Plus, this is The Family\\'s turf. Teaming up with them should make things easier for us in the future.\\n▶ **Himeko:** As for that Aventurine... Welt, I\\'d like to hear your thoughts.\\n▶ ▶ **Welt:** He\\'s complex. He deliberately slow\\\\-played his hand during negotiations while running circles round us all the while.\\n▶ **Welt:** He appealed convincingly to both reason and emotion. It wasn\\'t forced, but the intent was obvious.\\n▶ **Welt:** Still, it\\'s good to have contacts among all this uncertainty. Aventurine showed his skills, and as far as our interests are aligned, he can become a reliable ally.\\n▶ **Welt:** We also need to keep a certain distance from The Family — never let them get too close. Teaming up with the IPC helps balance that out — if either side makes a move, we have the option to pull out.\\n▶ **Himeko:** So you suggest accepting Aventurine\\'s proposal to team up?\\n▶ **Welt:** Yes... It\\'s risky, but we can only wait until both sides have played their cards before making any further judgments.\\n▶ ▶ **March 7th:** I get why, but there\\'s a whole lot of bad guys and girls around here and I\\'m worried about getting stabbed in the back. (Trailblazer) has been bullied a few times now, and I can\\'t stand it anymore...\\n It\\'s fine. Let\\'s focus on the big picture for now.\\n▶ **March 7th:** You\\'re like a broken record...\\n It\\'s fine. I got a lot out of him, too...\\n▶ **March 7th:** You...\\n▶ **March 7th:** ...No! I can\\'t accept this!\\n It\\'s cool. You can bully me whenever!\\n▶ **March 7th:** You...\\n▶ **March 7th:** ...No! I can\\'t accept this!\\n▶ **March 7th:** ...Forget about it. Just let me keep an eye on him! If that doesn\\'t work, we can just turn the tables and use him instead!\\n▶ ▶ **Himeko:** Then (Trailblazer), could you please reply to Aventurine? Everyone, take this time to put together your thoughts.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Open chat with Aventurine)\\nMessages  \\nAventurineWe\\'ll collaborate.(Trailblazer)We\\'ve decided to accept your request for collaborationAventurineWonderful. Your response came faster than I expectedFrom now on, we\\'ll all be in this togetherHere\\'s a small something for our upcoming partnership You have received 100,000 creditsThanks, boss.(Trailblazer)Wow weeThat\\'s so generous of you, boss. Thanks!That\\'s a LOTTA money!(Trailblazer)Bro, you should be more prudent with your moneyBut I\\'ll take them all just this one time.That\\'s it?(Trailblazer)That\\'s it?That doesn\\'t seem like much. Gimme another 100k, rich boy. Lemme see what you\\'ve gotAventurineOops. I pressed send too earlyHere\\'s a little extra just for good luck with this new gig You have received 100,000 creditsAventurineJust as I anticipated, The Family is going to sweep Robin\\'s case under the rug for as long as they can. So, her case is only a secret between usBut the other case... that depends on what excuses they have prepared for you guysI\\'ll take my leave for now. And I look forward to an outstanding performance from you guys!\\n(Obtain  Credit ×200,000)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (Looks like Aventurine is happy with this outcome... Let\\'s tell everyone about it.)\\n(Investigate shining spot in front of Clockie Statue, optional)\\nClockie\\'s smile forever radiant — It\\'s not yet known if his gaze can reach every dark corner in the realm of dreams.\\n\\n#### Talk to Himeko\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n\\n(Talk to Himeko)\\n▶ **Himeko:** Aventurine\\'s goal is to try and recapture Penacony for IPC. To do this, he\\'ll have to bring down The Family in its entirety to create a big enough chance.\\n▶ **Himeko:** The existence of \"Death\" will be covered up by The Family, so how does he plan on taking them down? It\\'s got to be something important enough that everyone will notice, but it also can\\'t be anything too out\\\\-in\\\\-the\\\\-open...\\n Perhaps he\\'s going for the Hotel?\\n▶ **Himeko:** An attack on the hotel guests? Unlikely. Penacony\\'s guests include quite a few big wigs known throughout the whole cosmos, people who not even the IPC would dare take lightly. Aventurine is a shrewd merchant, and there\\'s no way he doesn\\'t know that.\\n Perhaps he\\'s going for The Family?\\n▶ **Himeko:** He\\'s definitely going for The Family, and it\\'s just a matter of how. The Harmony is strong in Penacony and almost impossible to take on head\\\\-to\\\\-head. The fact that the IPC dispatched Aventurine shows that they do not intend to simply play by the book here.\\n Perhaps he\\'s going for Acheron?\\n▶ **Himeko:** Aventurine has devoted considerable attention to her. But this Galaxy Ranger... we know hardly anything about her and can\\'t rush to any conclusions.\\n Perhaps he\\'s going for the Astral Express?\\n▶ **Himeko:** ...I was also considering this possibility, especially... because he respects you so much, and has sought you out before a few times. Perhaps he\\'s also unsure of your intentions, and is probing you.\\n No conclusions can be drawn just yet.\\n▶ **Himeko:** ...I\\'m just speculating. In any case, we have to be careful when handling Aventurine. He\\'s skilled at reading people and discerning the right moment to strike. Also...\\n▶ **Himeko:** He\\'s clearly a born gambler if he\\'s willing to go all in to win.\\n(Talk to Himeko again, optional)\\n▶ **Himeko:** If Aventurine wants to bring down The Family, he\\'ll have to create a big enough chance. After everything he\\'s done so far — what is his goal...?\\n\\n#### Talk to March 7th\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n\\n(Talk to March 7th)\\n▶ **March 7th:** I hope it\\'s not too soon to bring it up, but I feel like... Miss Robin isn\\'t actually dead, but that she\\'s still alive and well somewhere. That everything\\'s just some... horrible prank...\\n▶ **March 7th:** Because... aren\\'t we supposed to be inside a dream? How could someone die in a beautiful dreamscape like this... Shouldn\\'t only good things happen here?\\n▶ **March 7th:** Whenever I see the grand theater, I just can\\'t stop all these thoughts from flooding my head...\\n Do you think The Family is behind all this?\\n▶ **March 7th:** No no, after all they\\'ve brought everyone this sleepy dreamscape which everyone loves. I just feel like I\\'m starting to understand them less and less...\\n We\\'ll restore all the dreams back to normal.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Yeah! Of course, at times like this we\\'re so lucky to have our Crew. The Family and the IPC — everyone has their own plans going on...\\n▶ **March 7th:** Everyone\\'s still having a great time out there on the streets. Nobody knows what\\'s happened... It\\'s all so unreal, as if Firefly, Miss Robin, and us... were all outsiders from another world.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Ahh... what a mess! I really want a nice cool drink of soda to help me calm down...\\n▶ **March 7th:** But then I\\'d be just like everyone else out on the streets...\\n(Talk to March 7th again, optional)\\n▶ **March 7th:** This dream... is becoming more and more separated from reality.\\n\\n#### Talk to Welt\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n\\n(Talk to Welt)\\n▶ **Welt:** Aventurine said something that concerns me...\\n▶ **Welt:** He accused that Galaxy Ranger of killing Robin without any evidence whatsoever... but said nothing about her connection to that Memory Zone Meme, or why he was stalking you.\\n▶ **Welt:** It was a groundless accusation... which only serves to make him seem more suspicious.\\n But why, though...?\\n Does Aventurine have other plans?\\n He\\'s bluffing.\\n▶ **Welt:** Maybe Aventurine\\'s goal was never to gain our trust. Maybe he wanted to foster a feeling of enmity toward Acheron and make the situation more volatile... Two birds, one stone.\\n▶ **Welt:** However, I asked Dan Heng back on the Express to confirm that story about the Annihilation Gang and the lost messages... It wasn\\'t something that Aventurine made up out of thin air.\\n▶ **Welt:** You\\'ve met her many times, now. What\\'s your impression of Miss Acheron?\\n ...She\\'s a very gentle woman?\\n Weird... I can\\'t seem to remember.\\n ...She\\'s a very mysterious woman?\\n Weird... I can\\'t seem to remember.\\n ...She\\'s a very powerful woman?\\n Weird... I can\\'t seem to remember.\\n Weird... I can\\'t seem to remember.\\n▶ **Welt:** ...That fits the stereotype of a Galaxy Ranger to a T.\\n▶ **Welt:** They\\'re eccentric, unpredictable, and fond of being alone. No wonder she\\'s a suspect.\\n(Talk to Welt again, optional)\\n▶ **Welt:** Whatever happens, please don\\'t place all your trust in Aventurine. We cannot afford to be manipulated by him.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(After talking to everyone)\\n▶ **Welt:** Looks like Aventurine doesn\\'t need anything else — let\\'s turn our attention to The Family\\'s assignment for now. Himeko, what do you think?\\n▶ ▶ **Himeko:** Among our current clues, the two murders that (Trailblazer) witnessed are the most directly connected. I suggest starting here.\\n▶ **Himeko:** One thing I\\'m curious about is, if a person dies in a dream, what happens to them in real life? Seeing as we\\'re at The Family\\'s behest, why not pop back out to reality and verify Miss Firefly\\'s situation back at the hotel... Perhaps we could also make a few inquiries about Miss Robin while we\\'re out there.\\n▶ **Welt:** How about we split off into two groups? There are still some things worth focusing on inside the Dreamscape — I\\'ll investigate those and we can link up again later.\\n▶ **Himeko:** Worth focusing on? ...Oh, no problem. I\\'ll leave it to you then.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Huh? Ah... I thought I\\'d finally get to see Himeko and Mr. Yang go out on a mission together. Oh well, take care then, Mr. Yang!\\n▶ **Welt:** I will. Keep in touch.\\n\\n### Speak with Acheron\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe spotlight refocuses on another location in Penacony. Let\\'s check out the happenings in places that you aren\\'t aware of. Golden Hour\\n\\n▶ **Welt:** ...\\n▶ **Welt:** Honored guest, could you come out for a second?\\n▶ **Acheron:** I\\'d be embarrassed too, getting stared at like that.\\n▶ **Welt:** Forgive me. My name is Welt Yang — I\\'m one of the Crew Members on the Astral Express. I believe you\\'ve met my colleagues.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Welt...\\n▶ **Welt:** ...Is there something about my name?\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...First, don\\'t you want to know my name?\\n▶ **Welt:** I already do, Miss Acheron. You\\'re a prominent figure in Penacony.\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...What are they saying about me?\\n▶ **Welt:** Some claim that you\\'re the real culprit behind these murders... that the Annihilation Gang\\'s tragic fate at the banquet was a result of your blade... and that you\\'re now attempting to unleash another bloodbath on Penacony.\\n▶ **Acheron:** The Annihilation Gang?\\n▶ **Welt:** Ifrit of Ever\\\\-Flame Mansion.\\n▶ **Acheron:** \"Tragic fate\"... That duke turned his dying body to flames and sacrificed his life as a martyr. He was a determined and heroic Pathstrider. Not even a villain should be disparaged like this.\\n▶ **Acheron:** And what\\'s more, there were plenty of suspects invited. Do they really think... that a blade is more dangerous than that \"black hole\" you\\'re wielding?\\n▶ **Welt:** ...Keen intuition. Not even The Family managed to point out the truth behind this cane.\\n▶ **Welt:** So you must surely know, Miss Acheron, that peering into a black hole is not a wise move. As a potential threat, your knowledge of us has reached uncomfortable depths...\\n▶ **Welt:** Reveal your true identity and intentions... Otherwise, brace yourself for gravitational disintegration.\\n▶ **Acheron:** That shouldn\\'t be necessary... but if it makes the Nameless feel less defensive, I\\'ll be happy to abide.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Believe it or not, Galaxy Ranger, Acheron... those are the names I go by to this very day. My trip to Penacony is solely to fulfill an old \"final request.\"\\n▶ **Acheron:** I\\'m here for the Watchmaker\\'s Legacy... and that\\'s it. I think I\\'ve been honest enough.\\n▶ **Welt:** Still unwilling to reveal your true identity?\\n▶ **Acheron:** It\\'s not that I don\\'t want to. It\\'s just that I can\\'t... I\\'ve come so far, and I can\\'t sum up all of that in just a few words.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Everyone has their own unspeakable past, secrets that they don\\'t want to be revealed... and I won\\'t be asking any more questions, such as why the Astral Express is roaming around the cosmos with a **Stellaron** on board.\\n▶ **Welt:** ...\\n▶ ▶ **Acheron:** Is (he/she) okay? That Memokeeper... didn\\'t do anything, right?\\n▶ ▶ **Welt:** (Trailblazer)\\'s fine. Let\\'s stick with the topic. Gaining my trust all depends on how much you\\'re willing to reveal.\\n▶ **Acheron:** I\\'ve run around many different Penacony dreamscapes just to try and find that \"Legacy,\" and during this period I came into contact with quite a few guests. In the process, I gradually came to realize...\\n▶ **Acheron:** The secret of Penacony... may be closely related to the Trailblaze.\\n▶ **Acheron:** That\\'s why I\\'ve come to ask for your help. I don\\'t have enough proof yet, but I\\'d like to speculate something: the source of all tragedy lies within The Family. If you could trust me... we could find the proof to support this claim, together.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Mr. Yang, I think you\\'ve come to the same conclusion, haven\\'t you?\\n▶ **Welt:** ...Let\\'s leave it at that. For now, I\\'ll choose to believe that you bear no hostility.\\n▶ **Welt:** Share your findings with me, and me alone. I don\\'t want vague conjecture to interfere with other people\\'s judgments before we find solid proof.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Mhmm.\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...By the way, would you like something to drink? Before we go, how about two cups of **Wake the Heck Up**...? No, four cups.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Because the conversation coming up... will last forever.\\n\\n### Recall the memories on Acheron\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe spotlight refocuses on another location in Penacony. Let\\'s check out the happenings in places that you aren\\'t aware of. The Reverie (Reality)\\n\\n**At the same time — Hotel in the real world**\\n▶ **Black Swan:** I\\'ve been watching her closely for a while now, and the first \"invitation\" was in the banquet hall of the hotel.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** She just sat in one corner keeping silent, chugging down a couple cups of **Wake the Heck Up**... I told her it\\'s a pungent, bitter beverage, not the taste of sweet dreams — only for people allergic to SoulGlad. And she said...\\n▶ **Acheron:** \"Really? But I don\\'t taste... any difference at all between them.\"\\n▶ **Black Swan:** The guest rooms are charmingly minimalist...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** ...An aesthetic you share, Miss Acheron.\\n\\n▶ **Black Swan:** It\\'s a cinch. This music box — the \"invitation\" received by the Annihilation Gang... There are latent memories that linger on it yet.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** You see, memories of you are not yours alone. They travel in other people... Other things. I know much, and I can predict even more. With some help, the dead can be made to speak.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** The Annihilation Gang, that band of desperadoes who all disappeared after meeting you... What exactly happened to them? Well, let me reveal all.\\n▶ **Voice in the Memory:** \"...Gradation twelve ██ Dreamscape twelve ██ Father ██ I dedicate this to you...\"\\n▶ **Voice in the Memory:** \"...Well done ██ Dubra ██ wherever they go, ██ shall be met by annihilation...\"\\n▶ **Black Swan:** ...There it is — it\\'s hazy, but it\\'s Ifrit\\'s voice.

Didn\\'t expect you to be back so soon. How is it... find anything?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Just as you guessed: Nobody outside knows about Robin\\'s death, there aren\\'t even baseless conspiracy theories. They\\'re still streaming the rehearsal for her ceremony — using a stand\\\\-in, I guess — \\\\*ahem\\\\* they must be dreaming.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Of course. Who could imagine that death would actually descend upon the idyllic dream created by The Family, let alone that the victim would be the female lead of the Charmony Festival...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** To be honest with you, I didn\\'t believe it and even **tested** it a few times myself — until I discovered that I couldn\\'t actually die. Whenever there\\'s any danger, I\\'m forced awake by the Dreampool and it\\'s all as if everything were just a nightmare.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** That\\'s why I\\'m convinced that there are a few big secrets lurking behind the scenes.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Then you must have heard about the Memory Zone meme\"Something Unto Death\" — when I graciously deigned to establish connections with the Oak Family on your behalf, they were quite in a pitiful state of disarray.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Besides Robin, there was another body. I don\\'t know the exact details, just that it was a stowaway.\\n▶ ▶ **Aventurine:** Two murder cases!? I told you, something seemed off about the Nameless. (He/She) must have come across the other one...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** This murderer is a psycho... but I have to say, the case does represent an opportunity. We can leverage The Family\\'s malfeasance and let the IPC use this as a reason to intervene.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** It\\'s just that their trickery runs deeper than I thought. Robin\\'s stand\\\\-in was all ready to go... These two murders are definitely getting hushed up.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** What should we do? Let me think... It\\'s too rare an opportunity to miss out on, so I gotta be careful...\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Incredible, gambler. Have you already exhausted your limited repertoire of tricks so soon?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** There are plenty of chips, but it\\'d be best to choose carefully. The most straightforward... has to be Robin. Remember? That Masked Fool once told me to **find a mute** as a friend.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Robin is what she calls the \"mute.\" She has lost her voice and while most people can\\'t pick up on it, you and I cannot mistake that sound — not produced by any voicebox, but rather by the resonance of the Harmony.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** If that girl hadn\\'t gone hoarse from singing practice, there\\'d only be one possibility: Something was up with The Family, or Robin herself. To get to the bottom of this, I tried every way I could to meet her...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...but she died, right before my very eyes.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** A complete and utter loss — incidentally, it seems to have resulted in your rather undignified arrival on the interrogation stand.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** There were eyewitnesses at the scene, and The Family, in their graciousness, has tentatively accepted your alibi. However, for the foreseeable future... you shall, regrettably, find yourself under the vigilant watch of the Hounds.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Things aren\\'t looking too optimistic, Doctor. I\\'m starting to break out in a cold sweat. Do you reckon... there\\'s still any chance of a comeback given how things are?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** A probability? Yes, it exists, but it verges on the infinitesimal. To phrase it in a manner more befitting the vernacular of Penacony, \"you\\'re dreaming.\"\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** But if you simply can\\'t control yourself and want to try your hand, then there just so happens to be a suitable candidate...\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** That man wants to see you again.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Who?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Sunday.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Is this a public hearing, or a private trial?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** If it were the former, it would hardly befit my stature to stoop to the role of a mere messenger.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Fine... That\\'s great. It\\'s all great. You see, the dead can\\'t talk — but the living can...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Ratio, I\\'m convinced now that there must be something wrong **inside** The Family. Just you wait and see, that man\\'s sister has died. He can\\'t sit on his hands.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Without any further ado, let\\'s set off — lead the way! The show... is about to begin.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** We\\'re here. The Dewlight Pavilion is the Oak Family\\'s fortress and a place where heads of the families meet to discuss great plans for Penacony.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Fortress? I like this metaphor. I had dealt with the warlords of the Iymanika star system not long ago, and their synchronized orbital manor wasn\\'t this heavily guarded.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** This mansion nominally belongs to Sunday, and is very befitting of its owner. Without his express invitation, the likes of ordinary guests would never grace these grounds in their lifetimes. Look around while you still have this moment of freedom.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Hey, Doc — Whose side are you on anyway?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Who\\'s to say I won\\'t sell you out?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** We\\'ll see. When we meet the authoritarian masterSunday of the Oak Family, I\\'ll pry an answer out of him.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Follow me, and I\\'ll bring you to his parlor. Hold your tongue and let me deal with the members of The Family.\\n(Open Fate\\'s Ensemble Tutorial)\\n\\n### Talk to Hendrick\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Mission Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe head of the Oak Family in Penacony, who seems to find you intriguing, invites you for a private chat. That\\'s exactly what you need. To meet him, you visit the Dewlight Pavilion with Dr. Ratio... having no inkling of the perils that lie ahead of you.  \\nTalk to Hendrick the guard and embark on you two\\'s adventure at the Dewlight Pavilion. Dewlight Pavilion\\n\\n(Talk to Hendrick)\\n▶ **Hendrick:** Hey, you two! That\\'s a place of business. No entry!\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** I was requested by Mr. Sunday to bring him the suspect. My name is Ratio. He should\\'ve mentioned it to you.\\n▶ **Hendrick:** Oh, I remember you... Veritas Ratio. Your \"Punch Virtual Particle Clock\" is impressive.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** ...Excuse me?\\n▶ **Hendrick:** The one on your head! Of course, it\\'s nothing compared to my... full pocket\\\\-dimensional annihilating power armor of the \"Mobile Knights.\"\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Right, and as I mentioned, that fantasy raiment of yours doesn\\'t exist.\\n▶ **Hendrick:** That\\'s because you can\\'t see it! Like I say, only FamilyMember of The Family can see the glory of the \"Mobile Knights.\" Enough, get going. Don\\'t keep Mr. Sunday waiting.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** \\\\*sigh\\\\*... It seems like the idiocy index here is no better than it is out there.\\n\\n### Head to the foyer\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nYou two reach a foyer full of statues and realize there is no way to proceed further... In other words, there is not even a door in sight. Looks like you have to find a way to conjure up a door...  \\nFortunately, the learned professor always knows what to do... Could he have studied the script before? Dewlight Pavilion\\n\\n(Talk to Hendrick, optional)\\n▶ **Hendrick:** Enough, get going. Don\\'t keep Mr. Sunday waiting.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Approach marked location)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...A dead end?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** The door is shut tight. Looks like we\\'re on our own.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I mean... there isn\\'t a door. How did you get in before?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** For security reasons, The Family built the administrative site deep in the Dreamscape, with the mechanisms hidden in these Nightingale statues. The direction of the statues can be controlled.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** On the previous occasion, an attendant named Conna had gone to the side room to verify something before setting the statues in the correct positions.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Maybe we should do the same. Let\\'s go and take a look. Of course, we can also use brute force.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Attempt to solve puzzle, optional)\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Solving a problem by brute force doesn\\'t prove your intelligence. The side room — don\\'t let me repeat myself.\\n(Solve puzzle without obtaining the clue, optional)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Look, like I said — brute force can also solve things.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** The Council of Mundanites should consider you as their member, for no one in this universe is more suitable to be there than you.\\n(Proceed to Head to the Dreammaster Hall)\\n\\n### Obtain the clue regarding the Nightingale Statue\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n\\n(Approach painting)\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Six Nightingales facing in different directions — an obvious hint.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Hmm... but are these Nightingales?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** They are. What\\'s wrong?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** How can Nightingales be so huge? They look more like Torment Eagles to me.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** There are no eagles in the Five Families, only Nightingales— Why am I wasting time with you on this?\\n**The two return on the path they came from...**\\n\\n### Solve the puzzle regarding the Nightingale Statue\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nYou two reach a foyer full of statues and realize there is no way to proceed further... In other words, there is not even a door in sight. Looks like you have to find a way to conjure up a door...  \\nYou two have obtained the clue regarding the Nightingale Statue, hoping that it can open up the path ahead. Dewlight Pavilion\\n\\n(Solve puzzle)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Just as I thought, here\\'s the correct answer.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** A truly miraculous discovery — perhaps I should offer you the chance to join the Genius Society?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Really? I thought you\\'d given up on that already.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** I was being sarcastic. Can\\'t you tell?\\n\\n### Head to the Dreammaster Hall\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nYou two reach a foyer full of statues and realize there is no way to proceed further... In other words, there is not even a door in sight. Looks like you have to find a way to conjure up a door...  \\nYou two really did conjure up a door! The Dreamscape is an amazing place, isn\\'t it? Dewlight Pavilion\\n\\n(Approach marked location)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Impressive. So much for Mr Sunday\\'s reserved, virtuous image.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Do you need me to remind you? We\\'re in a dreamscape. No matter how grand the mansion looks, it\\'ll not affect Penacony. Stop wasting your time nitpicking The Family here.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Yeah, you\\'re right. The only way to destroy The Family is \"Death.\" Sunday must have thought the same. Let\\'s head down.\\n\\n### Head to The Family\\'s council chamber and face Sunday\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nYou two have successfully solved the puzzle about the Nightingale Statue. After walking through a narrow and long hallway, you find yourself in a luxurious classical hall.  \\nYou two will get to meet the head of the Oak Family with the odd name after passing through the hall. Dewlight Pavilion\\n\\n(Approach door)\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** ...Hold on.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** What\\'s wrong? Are we heading the wrong way?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** No, but this door is locked.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** My friend, did you really make an appointment with him?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** ...It\\'s a trial. You got to prove your worth to Sunday before you can speak with him.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** If I\\'m not wrong, we need to find a way to open this door in the hall, or this place will be our prison.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Oh, an escape room — my favorite.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Get serious. I\\'ve no time for games. Let\\'s head back. The hint is probably in that prominent sandpit.\\n(Talk to Dr. Ratio again, optional)\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Get serious. I\\'ve no time for games. Let\\'s head back. The hint is probably in that prominent sandpit.\\n\\n### Inspect the sandpit\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs expected, things are far from straightforward. How can the outsiders gain access to The Family\\'s council chamber that easily? But fret not, as Dr. Ratio always has the solution. He speculates that the key to unlocking the door is hidden in the sandpit in the center of the hall. Dewlight Pavilion\\n\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Wow, that\\'s an enormous sandpit... I\\'d love to build a tall building for myself once I have enough savings.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Investigate sandpit)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Look, there\\'s a noticeable gap in the model. I believe you\\'re right.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** There wasn\\'t a gap before. That man must have done it intentionally.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** With your brilliant mind you shouldn\\'t have any trouble recalling what was here last time, right, Doctor?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Of course.\\n\\n### Head to the treasure room to look for a clue related to the sandpit\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nThere is a noticeable gap in the sandpit model, which might just be the key clue to unlocking the council chamber. As far as Dr. Ratio can remember, the block that can fit the gap is kept in the treasure room nearby.  \\nThe professor is as reliable as always! Dewlight Pavilion\\n\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Let\\'s look around. When I see it, I will know it.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Fine, fine. Why do I feel that we\\'re pursuing a degree in burglary now?\\n\\n### Look for the sandpit clue in the treasure room\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nThere is a noticeable gap in the sandpit model, which might just be the key clue to unlocking the council chamber. As far as Dr. Ratio can remember, the block that can fit the gap is kept in the treasure room nearby.  \\nYou two arrive at the treasure room, all set to pursue a degree in burglary — that is, to look for the missing part of the sandpit model. Good luck. Dewlight Pavilion\\n\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Found it. This is it.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Investigate model)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** The nameplate reads: Gulliver\\'s Arch. I\\'m amazed you can remember something this tiny. You know, this reminds me of a tunnel I once saw that could shrink people who passed through it.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** If I were you, I would shut my mouth. It\\'s wise to remain silent when you should.\\n\\n### Inspect the sandpit again\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nYou two come across a wondrous item called Gulliver\\'s Arch in the treasure room. If you\\'ve watched the fun animation with a blue cat from the future as the protagonist, then the item will surely remind you of the tunnel that can shrink the pers—  \\nAhem, the rest of the content will not be shown due to copyright issues. Now, please put the arch on the sandpit. Dewlight Pavilion\\n\\n**The two return to the lobby...**\\n(Approach marked location)\\n Insert Gulliver\\'s Arch into the slot.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** This reminds me of one of those building toys. With the blocks? I\\'ve never played with them before. I wonder if it\\'s more interesting than stacking chips.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Look, the gap is closed, and it fits perfectly — eh, so what\\'s next?\\n\\n### Interact with Gulliver\\'s Arch\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n\\n(Enter the City Sandpit)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Waaaaaah...!\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Good heavens. Did I shrink? Am I still in a dream?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Indeed.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Doctor... you\\'re huge! It\\'s me! Down here in the sandpit!\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Actually I think we could make this work for us. Just find a way to slip me into Sunday\\'s collar, and I\\'ll infiltrate The Family just like that.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** ...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Fine. I was just kidding.\\n\\n### Investigate the Dream Jigsaw\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nDream Jigsaws are ubiquitous in Penacony. Generally speaking, seeing a Dream Jigsaw is the same as seeing a door... Intentional or not, this creepy design is so common in Penacony that it makes you wonder whether The Family has run out of creative ideas.  \\nAnyway, you might as well go through the procedure and collect all the jigsaw fragments. You know how your professor friend isn\\'t known for his patience. Dewlight Pavilion\\n\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Let\\'s find a way to open the door.\\n\\n#### Talk to the Oak Family Soldier\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n\\n(Approach Oak Family Soldier)\\n▶ **Oak Family Soldier:** Hello. Welcome to the Golden Hour base model.\\n▶ **Oak Family Soldier:** I am an Oak Soldier. I will be here to guide you through the tour of the base model.

Now The Family\\'s toys are trying to frame me? I didn\\'t do a thing to it, Doc. You\\'ve gotta be my witness.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** I saw nothing.\\n(Talk to Oak Family Soldier, optional)\\nIt has crashed. It may take some time to reboot.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Approach capsule machine)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Capsule machine... There\\'s no mechanism on the floor. Could there be one at the top? Doctor, do me a favor —\\n\\n#### Collect Jigsaw Fragments\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n\\n▶ **Aventurine:** So I was right. These models have interiors that look exactly like the real buildings. The only difference is that no one lives in them.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Funny that Sunday puts a miniature that makes him seem like a **giant** by comparison right where he can see it first thing in the morning. Insecure much?\\n(Collect jigsaw fragment from capsule)\\n(Collect jigsaw fragment near enemies)\\n\\n### Investigate the suspicious\\\\-looking empty base\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n\\n▶ **Aventurine:** One of the fragments flew upstairs. I\\'ll need to use the pinball machine to flick myself up there, but it\\'s tough.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Investigate base)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Great. There\\'s another pinball machine base here, and it\\'s empty too.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Doc, I\\'ll need your brainpower again.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** There\\'s no need to yell, I can hear you. The pinball machine must be hidden somewhere in the hall, like the arch. Wait here, and I\\'ll be back in a minute.\\n\\n### Head to the Meditation Room and look for the pinball machine model\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nYou ask the knowledgeable Dr. Ratio to help you look for a pinball machine model in the Meditation Room. So happy for him! Dewlight Pavilion\\n\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Finally, a moment of peace.\\n(Investigate sandpit, optional)\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Quite a fascinating contraption. I would rate it more favorably if that clamorous little person inside were gone.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Ratio... I can hear you...\\n(Stay idle at north side of sandpit)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Doctor... Shake a leg...?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Without that Pinball machine, neither one of us is going anywhere anytime soon.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** ...\\n(Investigate model)\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** That\\'s it... Pleasant moments of solitude are always fleeting.\\n(Obtain  Pinball Machine Model ×1)\\n\\n### Place the pinball machine model on the sandpit\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nYou ask the knowledgeable Dr. Ratio to help you look for a pinball machine model in the Meditation Room, and he manages to find it. So happy for him! Dewlight Pavilion\\n\\n(Approach sandpit)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Ha, you\\'re back! Just place it here... Thank you...!\\n Place the model in the sandpit.\\n\\n### Head to higher ground to collect Jigsaw Fragments\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nDream Jigsaws are ubiquitous in Penacony. Generally speaking, seeing a Dream Jigsaw is the same as seeing a door... Intentional or not, this creepy design is so common in Penacony that it makes you wonder whether The Family has run out of creative ideas.  \\nAnyway, you might as well go through the procedure and collect all the jigsaw fragments. You know how your professor friend isn\\'t known for his patience. Dewlight Pavilion\\n\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Thanks, Doc!\\n(Approach marked location)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Ratio, you should come in and take a look. The view here is breathtaking. Honestly, you could easily squash me with just a pinch.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** If that is your wish, I will do so without a moment\\'s hesitation.\\n(Collect jigsaw fragment)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** All done. Piece of cake.\\n\\n### Complete the Dream Jigsaw\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nDream Jigsaws are ubiquitous in Penacony. Generally speaking, seeing a Dream Jigsaw is the same as seeing a door... Intentional or not, this creepy design is so common in Penacony that it makes you wonder whether The Family has run out of creative ideas.  \\nFinally, you have collected all the fragments. It\\'s high time to leave this desolate and eerie place. Dewlight Pavilion\\n\\n(Solve Dream Jigsaw)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** And the joyous tour of Toy City has come to an end. It makes me feel sad.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Penacony isn\\'t all bad, right? I\\'ll use this interesting experience as a talking point at the poker table.\\n\\n### Head to The Family\\'s council chamber and face Sunday\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nNow, you\\'re all set to meet the head of Oak Family. Good luck. Dewlight Pavilion\\n\\n(Approach marked location)\\n\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** It\\'s a pity you made it out of the sandpit alive. Sunday is just beyond this door. From my limited understanding, he\\'s not someone easily handled. Are you prepared?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Yeah, only I believe he\\'s the one who should be prepared to face me.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Tell me about your plan.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I don\\'t have a plan. I\\'ll just play it by ear. There are only two kinds of bargaining chips when dealing with people: Benefit or fear.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Looks like \"sincerity\" isn\\'t in your dictionary.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Am I not sincere enough? There\\'s no need to emphasize it. We\\'ve got to make good use of death. That man\\'s sister is dead. He won\\'t be able to turn a blind eye, and that\\'s \"fear.\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** And I\\'ll help him find the murderer. He can\\'t do it due to his status and position, but I can, and that\\'s \"benefit.\"\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** On what basis do you believe he\\'s incapable, necessitating the delegation to someone from a rival faction, the IPC?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Simple — Because that murderer could very well be a **traitor** hiding inside The Family.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** ...Do you mean the Galaxy Ranger whom you accused previously?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** That was just an excuse, good doctor. There\\'s something wrong with that woman, and we need someone to keep her in check. It\\'s better to minimize the variables outside of our control when we execute our plans.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Moreover, I need to know her identity. If I\\'m lucky, she could be an important pawn. And it\\'s good to have more helpful **friends** when dealing with this matter.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** But honestly, the murder case is likely unrelated to her. I believe my standpoint: There\\'s a rat in The Family. Otherwise, why would Mr. Sunday arrange a private meeting with us? This isn\\'t an interrogation, but a secret negotiation.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** We\\'ll see. Using Robin\\'s death as a bargaining chip, I\\'ll win back my freedom and power. In the end, I\\'ll ruin this beautiful dream and create the grandest death.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** If the chance of winning is just beyond this door, even if that chance is close to zero, well... you can\\'t win if you don\\'t play, right?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Ah, the charming audacity! To think that you, of all people, might emerge victorious, dear gambler.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Three chips are enough.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** All or nothing.\\n\\n### Meet Sunday face\\\\-to\\\\-face\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n\\n(Approach marked location)\\n▶ **Sunday:** It seems my puzzles are too effortless for you, IPC Ambassador.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I appreciate your words, and I see you put a lot of effort into welcoming me, Mr. Sunday. However, this is no way to greet a guest.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Well, this isn\\'t an invitation, but a summoning. Before we speak, I need to test your character.\\n▶ **Sunday:** I imagine this knowledgeable doctor friend of yours has been of great help, yes?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Certainly, you ought to know this better than I do — he has already faithfully fulfilled his duties, hasn\\'t he?\\n▶ **Sunday:** Yes, the doctor has assured me of your noble character. He considers you, like himself, a virtuous person who can be trusted by The Family.\\n▶ **Sunday:** I have come to know you very well as a person, Mr. Aventurine. You\\'re diligent, generous, and willing to cooperate. The fact that you succeeded in overcoming many obstacles just to meet me gave me the reason to believe in your wisdom and courage.\\n▶ **Sunday:** But there\\'s one thing I must ask you — that is, you\\'ve used your wisdom at the wrong place to meet the wrong person and put yourself in a situation where you shouldn\\'t be... witnessing a tragedyRobin\\'s Case that shouldn\\'t have happened.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** You don\\'t look too well. Am I making you anxious?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...If not, then it means I\\'m on your side.\\n▶ **Sunday:** If I wasn\\'t mistaken, you\\'d just made a serious accusation against **The Family**.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** You weren\\'t mistaken, for depravity is creeping in around you.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** There\\'s no need for us to be evasive. Let\\'s talk about your sister. Your sister\\'s talent is unrivaled in the world of show business. As you know, her voice has been **out of tune** since she returned to Penacony. What\\'s more disheartening, she can\\'t sing anymoreDeath.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Who could be responsible for this? Many suspect the culprit is among the outsiders, but I know... you hold a different opinion.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Now, your noble status has become a shackle, preventing you from apprehending the murderer and avenging your sister\\'s death. You\\'re feeling anxious because you\\'re out on a limb.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** But don\\'t worry. I am on your side.\\n▶ **Sunday:** I\\'m immensely honored by your concern for me, Mr. Aventurine — since you\\'re so selfless and generous, I believe you wouldn\\'t ask for anything in return, would you?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Naturally, you wouldn\\'t incur any loss from this. I just want to reclaim what is mine: My liberty, and the personal items under The Family\\'s custody — the bag of gift money, and...\\n▶ **Sunday:** The box in which the Cornerstone is stored.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** That\\'s right.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Cornerstone — I\\'ve heard it\\'s a treasured asset of the Strategic Investment Department, a sacred stone that seals the \"Preservation\" Emanator, granting significant power, and every Liquidation SpecialistTen Stonehearts holds one.\\n▶ **Sunday:** ...For an object so precious, it probably comes at an even higher price than other forms of recompense.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I\\'m sure you\\'re aware of the high level of risk I\\'ll be undertaking to bring the truth to light.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Mr. Aventurine, when you\\'re out and about, do you always make adjustments to your appearance? Your tie should be on the center line, your shirt must not protrude from your vest, your trouser creases should be perfectly straight, and always aligned with the tips of your shoes.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Of course.\\n▶ **Sunday:** But I don\\'t, because it\\'s not **appropriate** to do so in public — you should make sure everything is presentable and in order before leaving the house.\\n▶ **Sunday:** I\\'m not the kind that takes risks. The Cornerstone must be in the custody of The Family.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** No room for negotiation?\\n▶ **Sunday:** Please don\\'t let me turn you down twice.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Sure. The gift money is good enough. I suppose you wouldn\\'t mind that? After all, a merchant can\\'t function without a bargaining chip.\\n▶ **Sunday:** You compromised quicker than I thought. Unfortunately, it\\'s a gambler that needs a bargaining chip... not a merchant. I can give you your gift money, but before that, I want you to tell me —\\n▶ **Sunday:** — The fact that you can decisively forsake the box you asked for, what exactly is stored in it?\\n▶ **Sunday:** \"Oh, Triple\\\\-Faced Soul, please sear his tongue and palms with a hot iron, so that he will not be able to fabricate lies and make false vows.\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...What have you done?\\n▶ **Sunday:** Under the light of the Harmony, all wickedness is revealed. I implore THEM to shed THEIR light, and I\\'ll ask you questions on THEIR behalf. Next... you have 113 seconds to prove your innocence and gain my trust.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** And if I refuse to answer?\\n▶ **Sunday:** You can try — and we\\'ll see if the Harmony rejects you.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...\\n▶ **Sunday:** \"Question: Do you own a Cornerstone?\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Yes.\\n▶ **Sunday:** What a simple answer. You, too, understand that idle chatter leads only to poverty.\\n▶ **Sunday:** \"Did you hand over the Cornerstone to The Family when you entered Penacony?\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Yes.\\n▶ **Sunday:** \"Does the Cornerstone you handed over to The Family belong to you?\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Yes.\\n▶ **Sunday:** \"Is your Cornerstone in this room right now?\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Yes.\\n▶ **Sunday:** \"Is your memory free from any kind of tampering or deletion, encompassing but not restricted to the techniques of the Garden of Recollection?\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Yes.\\n▶ **Sunday:** \"Are you an Avgin from Sigonia?\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Yes. You even know about that?\\n▶ **Sunday:** \"Do the Avgins have any ability to read, tamper with, or manipulate one\\'s own or another\\'s mind?\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** No. Does it matter?\\n▶ **Sunday:** \"Do you love your family more than yourself?\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Yes.\\n▶ **Sunday:** \"All the Avgins were killed in a massacre. Am I right?\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** No.\\n▶ **Sunday:** \"Are you your clan\\'s sole survivor?\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Perhaps.\\n▶ **Sunday:** \"...Do you hate and wish to destroy this world with your own hands?\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I don\\'t know.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Interesting. Now, the final question...\\n▶ **Sunday:** \"Can you swear that at this very moment, the Aventurine stone is safe and sound in this box?\"\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** ...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Of course.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Looks like we can get an answer.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Open it, Mr. Aventurine... It\\'s your last chance to defend your honor.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Cutscene plays)\\n\\n**Sunday:** Please.\\n**Sunday:** Are these what you\\'re looking for?\\n(Cutscene ends)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n**System hours ago — Dewlight Pavilion**\\n▶ **Sunday:** Since you came as promised, learned Doctor... Does this mean that you are willing to take the side of The Family in this farce?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** What makes you think you can convince me?\\n▶ **Sunday:** I\\'ve heard you haven\\'t enjoyed Mr. Aventurine\\'s company. I also understand that you\\'re an avid learner who sees the pursuit of knowledge above all.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** In that case, you ought to realize that a competent scholar knows their position and wouldn\\'t forsake more vital matters for the sake of petty pride.\\n▶ **Sunday:** If you agree to assist The Family, I\\'ll share our research findings on the Stellaron. You must be quite aware that, besides The Family, no other faction is willing to share such information.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** ...\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Cut to the chase. What do you need from me?\\n▶ **Sunday:** I need Mr. Aventurine\\'s comprehensive plan.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Haven\\'t you confiscated his Cornerstone? You can\\'t expect a featherless bird to take flight.\\n▶ **Sunday:** But I\\'ve also heard the ten elitesTen Stonehearts in the Strategic Investment Department have united, progressing together in the interests of the IPC.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** You\\'ll have to speak more clearly than that.\\n▶ **Sunday:** The Cornerstone which Mr. Aventurine surrendered — was it really his?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** You question whether he would entrust you with someone else\\'s Cornerstone? The Ten Stonehearts aren\\'t as united as you think — Cornerstones are significantly more precious to them than their very own lives.\\n▶ **Sunday:** But you know that he\\'s a crazed gambler. The more vocal he is about it, the more cautious I must be.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** I never imagined someone would share his way of thinking. Honestly, you should see a shrink.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Bring it. The box containing Cornerstone is unique, and only IPC senior staff and related members can access it — but I happen to be among them.\\n▶ **Sunday:** I appreciate it.\\n\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Unfortunately, your guess is correct.\\n▶ **Sunday:** ...\\n▶ **Sunday:** Ha, the golden stone. Its color and glow are similar to that of Qlipoth\\'s body.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** This is the very ruse he intends to use to fool you. He won\\'t reveal to you that the Ten Stonehearts chisel their own will into the Cornerstones, granting them an unparalleled radiance.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** And this golden stone is also known as a topaz, not aventurine, and it belongs to TopazOne of the Ten Stonehearts.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** So? Do you wish to confront him?\\n▶ **Sunday:** Not at the moment. I\\'m more interested to know the location of his Cornerstone.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** The safest place, somewhere you\\'d never think of. Because he never intended to hide it — in fact, that Cornerstone has been in your hands from the very beginning.\\n\\n▶ **Sunday:** I see, this bag... Mixing a Cornerstone, more precious than life itself, with a bunch of worthless jewels, disguised as a gift of money waiting to be confiscated, is indeed in line with Mr. AventurineGambler\\'s style.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Then he makes up some trivial excuse, downplaying the matter, and requests the gift money. This is a gamble, one he\\'s all too familiar with, betting on your single misstep leading to a total loss.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Learned Doctor, I\\'m grateful for your help. The Family will surely reward a righteous person like you.\\n▶ **Sunday:** As for the villain... I hope he retreats in humiliation.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Sunday:** It was all thanks to your friend with a keen eye that I could add a blot of utter failure to your storied career.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Ratio, you wretch...\\n▶ **Sunday:** Finally shown your true colors, heh. Oh, and just to remind you: You **currently** only have seventeen system hours left to live. Treasure your remaining time, and savor the delectable aftertaste of defeat.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...You might as well explain yourself a little more clearly.\\n▶ **Sunday:** What I performed on you just now was the Harmony\\'s consecration. You were to show allegiance beneath the illumination of THEIR grace, yet you acted willfully, uttering nothing but falsehoods, transforming the consecration into a trial. I genuinely see no reason to absolve you from it.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Is this what the Harmony represents? Is it built upon constraint and coercion?\\n▶ **Sunday:** You misunderstand, Mr. Aventurine. Punishment is meant for the irreverent, but I have seen your resilient spirit, and thus I offer you the possibility of a new beginning.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Throughout these seventeen system hours, you will be unable to escape the Dreamscape or contact any of your companions. You only have two paths before you, and it all depends on whether you can complete my test within the time limit.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Should you succeed, you will be able to coalesce into the Harmony and be with your Family. If you fail, you will suffer the wrath of the Eternal CenturionEmbodiment of Harmony and fall into an abyss of doom.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Sounds like I\\'m going to end up the same either way.\\n▶ **Sunday:** I indeed do need a servant to help me uncover the evil hidden in The Family from an external perspective. I will purge the **evil** from the inside and bring the real culprits to justice within seventeen system hours.\\n▶ **Sunday:** When the time comes, compare your findings with mine. If both our findings align, or if you can provide me more insights... then THEY will truly be able to grant you mercy and honesty.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Shameless hypocrites... You took everything from me and still demand the truth? That isn\\'t fair. Your carnival reeks with the stench of cash. Nothing is achievable without it!\\n▶ **Sunday:** This is meant to be an act of personal virtue, not requiring The Family\\'s support. Your bag is over there, do as you please. I believe you can trade this bag of worthless jewels for everything you need. That\\'s what gamblers excel at, isn\\'t it?\\n▶ **Sunday:** Off you go, Mr. Aventurine. You are **free**. I will wait here for your good news.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** This meeting isn\\'t an interrogation, or a negotiation...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** It\\'s an outright execution.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Why would I do that, Mr. Aventurine? I\\'m just wondering what a **passerby** who **stumbled** upon a scene of murder could have **found** out, that\\'s all.\\n**Aventurine:** ...\\n▶ **Sunday:** By the way, before you go, I have a personal question.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** What is it now?\\n▶ **Sunday:** You...\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Sunday:** ...Do you truly wish to bring about the destruction of this world?\\n...\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nMedia:Trailblaze Mission Double Indemnity 2\\\\.mp4   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n▶ **???:** Kakavasha, where did you go...

Or, is that also part of your act?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Didn\\'t think you\\'d have the nerve to show yourself.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** I thought this was exactly what you wanted. After all, I faithfully fulfilled my duties as you instructed.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Just tell me if you can\\'t hold on any longer.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** So, the \"genius\" of the Council of Mundanites wants to be my undertaker now? My... what an honor.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Yeah, and I\\'m pretty sure the people at the Strategic Investment Department would love to be notified of your death in due time, but let\\'s not forget you won\\'t be seeing them, because I\\'m the manager of this task.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Great, then tell your people that Aventurine is ready to go in seventeen system hours.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** You\\'ve got a lot of nerve — how exactly do you plan on completing your task while your hands are tied by the Harmony?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** My conversation with Sunday convinced me that there\\'s a traitor in The Family, and that they hold the secrets of Penacony... So, I took the opportunity to set everything in motion.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I even managed to recover the gift money. Things haven\\'t gone this smoothly since I walked through the doors of The Reverie... Now, I\\'m only one step away from victory.

You betrayed me.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Go, do what you must. I look forward to the sight of the IPC fleet surrounding Penacony. You\\'ve achieved what you desired, haven\\'t you?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** That\\'s true, but what\\'s your plan? Did you conceal an Orbital Support beacon in that gift money bag?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Well, who knows?

Do you know where I can find \"Death\" in this dream?\\n▶ **Chabro:** Ah, I see! Another fearless youngster looking for death, huh? Well, let me give you a piece of advice. Don\\'t think you\\'re the first one who\\'s ever thought of that idea.\\n▶ **Chabro:** Death? Not even remotely innovative. I bought it from Dr. Edward. He claimed it was some exclusive fancy\\\\-schmancy stuff... But what a disappointment.\\n▶ **Chabro:** The effects were awful. First, some monster covered in eyes stabs you in the gut, and then all you see are blurry glimpses of buildings and lights. The sky was spinning so fast it almost made me puke...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Is that all?\\n▶ **Chabro:** Yeah, what else can you expect? Don\\'t put too much stock in the Penacony movie industry... They even call this junk \"groundbreaking art,\" can you believe it?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...What a joke. Well, I\\'ll leave you be, then. I hope you have a wonderful day!\\n▶ **Aventurine:** (A monster covered in eyes... that sounds like the Memory Zone Meme, but buildings and lights... I don\\'t think those have anything to do with \"Death.\" That whole dream bubble was probably created using rumors and gossip.)\\n(Talk to Chabro again, optional)\\n▶ **Chabro:** The world has truly lost its way...\\n(Attempt to leave Aideen Park, optional)\\nIt\\'s not yet time to do this now — give out the gems and get some clues on the stowaway, then see if \\\\*that girl\\\\* will take the bait.\\n(After talking to the first person)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** (Ehhh... I can feel something inside my head... Is the \"Harmony\" starting to kick in?)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Talk to Larose)\\n▶ **Larose:** Would you be willing to support my performance, and keep the Song of Beauty alive in the cosmos?\\n Here, I got these gems for you.\\n▶ **Larose:** Wow, how fabulous! But why would you give such a wonderful gift to a random stranger like me?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Well, you see... I can\\'t bear to see anyone in this sweet dream suffering from poverty.\\n▶ **Larose:** That\\'s... incredibly kind of you. Thank you so much, sir. If you ever get the chance, please feel free to come by and indulge in my singing.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Sure thing. By the way, do you happen to know anything interesting about \"Death\"?\\n▶ **Larose:** \"Death\"? That\\'s... a pretty scary topic, and it doesn\\'t really match the mood of this sweet dream.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** You see, I\\'m a tabloid reporter collecting ghost stories in Penacony. As you know, the more chilling the stories... the more attention they get. Maybe you could help me out?\\n▶ **Larose:** Well, if you\\'re up for some gossip... It\\'s not about death, but there have been some rumors about a guest at the reality Hotel who fell into a deep sleep and didn\\'t wake up.\\n▶ **Larose:** It was like they were in some sort of coma. Nobody knows what caused it, but luckily, the customer eventually regained consciousness... Well, all customers are under the protection of The Family, after all.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Thank you. This will make for a very juicy headline. May Xipe protect us.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** (Unexplained coma? That\\'s actually what happens to your body if your brain dies in a dream, but unfortunately, the customer ended up waking up in the end.)\\n(Talk to Larose again, optional)\\n▶ **Larose:** Would you be willing to support my performance, and keep the Song of Beauty alive in the cosmos?\\n(After talking to the second person)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** (The disturbing voice in my head... it\\'s getting closer.)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Talk to Bocchi)\\n▶ **Bocchi:** A sip of liquor, a blissful reprieve... To drown a thousand sorrows, let worries leave... Hah, I know I have what it takes to become a poet...\\n Here, I got these gems for you.\\n▶ **Bocchi:** Oh? You... you are giving... these gems to me? Didn\\'t expect to meet such a generous soul in this place...\\n▶ **Bocchi:** Or are you just pitying me? Well, it doesn\\'t really matter... As long as I have... SoulGlad... that\\'s enough. This is just a dream after all... Haha...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** You really shouldn\\'t drink so much SoulGlad, my friend. It\\'s not good for your health.\\n▶ **Bocchi:** Oh! Hah, maybe I really should quit... but not before meeting... the Devil of SoulGlad...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** The Devil of SoulGlad... Care to elaborate?\\n▶ **Bocchi:** Haha... yeah... It\\'s a... seahorse... with a long neck!\\n▶ **Bocchi:** They say... it loves to appear to drunk people... especially the ones... who are passed out on the side of the road! Hah! How funny...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Yeah, very funny indeed. Thank you.\\n(Talk to Bocchi again, optional)\\n▶ **Bocchi:** A sip of liquor, a blissful reprieve... To drown a thousand sorrows, let worries leave... Hah, I know I have what it takes to become a poet...\\n(After talking to the third person)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** (Does everyone have to go through so much torment before joining The Family?... Darn it, now I just want to dig out my brain and use it as evidence...)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Talk to Woolsey)\\n▶ **Woolsey:** Take care, my friend. If you ever find yourself in danger, remember that the Hounds are always ready to help.\\n Here, I got these gems for you.\\n▶ **Woolsey:** ...\\nThe expression on this hunk of a man was complex, as if he were looking at a mud\\\\-soaked sparrow, unable to fly and nearing its end.\\n▶ **Woolsey:** You don\\'t look good, my friend... If you need assistance, I can contact the hotel and have them wake you up forcefully.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** That won\\'t be necessary. I have some business to attend to... but thank you all the same.\\n▶ **Woolsey:** Alright then. If you ever need help, don\\'t hesitate to reach out to us Hounds.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Well, actually, I do need a favor... As the most outstanding Hound in Penacony, have you come across any stowaways recently?\\n▶ **Woolsey:** Stowaways? How could there be stowaways in Penacony? We\\'ve never had anything like that before.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** All right... Good luck with your work, then.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** (What was I even thinking...? The Family would never share intel with the IPC...)\\n(Talk to Woolsey again, optional)\\n▶ **Woolsey:** Take care, my friend. If you ever find yourself in danger, remember that the Hounds are always ready to help.\\n(After talking to the fourth person)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Talk to Uma)\\n▶ **Uma:** You want to talk to me? Sure, but nothing too sensitive, okay?\\n Here, I got these gems for you.\\n▶ **Uma:** Wealthy people have fancy ways to enjoy this dream, but to be honest, I\\'ve never seen anyone who gives out money to others like you.\\n▶ **Uma:** So, are you trying to be the prince from the tale, handing out his gold\\\\-leaf garment and melting his lead heart in the fire?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Haha, I\\'m flattered. I\\'m no prince, and I just thought these gems would help you speak. So, as an investigative reporter, maybe you have heard of something about \"Death\"?\\n▶ **Uma:** Another curious soul, I see. Well, that was actually the topic I was most into when I entered the industry, but my boss shut it down.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** How did your boss talk you out of it?\\n▶ **Uma:** Well... She simply said, \"Covering baseless urban legends like that would make us look like some third\\\\-rate tabloid.\"\\n▶ **Uma:** I thought about it, and she had a point... Reporting on stuff like blowing out birthday candles and getting spooked by nightmare ghosts... isn\\'t exactly professional material.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Heh, I guess she\\'s got a point... Thank you for sharing.\\n(Talk to Uma again, optional)\\n▶ **Uma:** You want to talk to me? Sure, but nothing too sensitive, okay?\\n(After talking to the fifth person)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Talk to Barrle)\\n▶ **Barrle:** Hmm... Were you wanting to talk to me? Sorry, I thought you were checking out something behind me.\\n Here, I got these gems for you.\\n▶ **Barrle:** Is this... a gift for me? Are you sure this isn\\'t some kind of mistake?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Yes, it\\'s for you... Just take it.\\n▶ **Barrle:** Is this for real? Someone is actually giving me a gift? Not for my parents, but for me... Thank you, thank you so much!\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Oh, it\\'s not much. I just want to ask you something.\\n▶ **Barrle:** ...Ugh, I knew it. What\\'s on your mind? Are you trying to ask about my father, or my mother?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Um... neither. I just wanted to know if you\\'ve ever heard about \"Death\" in the Dreamscape?\\n▶ **Barrle:** Oh, you sound just like my father... Always warning me about danger even in dreams.\\n▶ **Barrle:** He\\'s an Intellitron, so his dream entry methods are different from us organics. Can\\'t count on him to protect me if something does go haywire. Funny, right now I\\'m still under his protection... Heh, how ironic...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Hey, stay positive. Gold will always shine one day, right?\\n(Talk to Barrle again, optional)\\n▶ **Barrle:** Hmm... Were you wanting to talk to me? Sorry, I thought you were checking out something behind me.\\n\\n### Distribute the last of the gems\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nYou are about to run out of money, and the ringing in your ears is getting louder. It does not bode well, and you need to hurry up. Golden Hour\\n\\n▶ **Aventurine:** (The Devil of SoulGlad, dangers in the dream, and nightmare ghosts... Surely, \"Death\" is a popular topic in this sweet dream granted by The Family. I\\'ve collected a bunch of rumors, but no useful clues...)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** (The gems in my bag are running low... Let\\'s see if my last lucky interviewee brings some surprises.)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Approach marked location)\\n▶ **???:** Remember what I said? You Sigonians are better off hiding in the sewers...\\n▶ **???:** Look at you, snooping around and sticking your nose everywhere...\\n▶ **Sparkle:** Is the smell of \"Death\" so enticing, my fine fellow?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Heh... it\\'s you, Masked Fool. I should have guessed it. You\\'re the \"imposter\" who appeared on TV after Robin\\'s death, right?\\n▶ **Sparkle:** I heard you got caught by The Family? I gave you a clear clue... \"Befriend a mute.\" Simple and straightforward, you know...?\\n▶ **Sparkle:** And what did you do? You messed it up and ended up as their prisoner. I told you to make friends with a mute, not become one yourself. You really let me down.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...What do you mean?\\n▶ **Sparkle:** You know better than I do. Who watched the little songbird that couldn\\'t sing perish right before their eyes? You did, Blondie.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** No, I mean... what did you mean by \"becoming one myself\"?\\n▶ **Sparkle:** Well, it means you\\'ll soon end up like her, unable to speak ever again.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...\\n▶ **Sparkle:** But it\\'s a good thing, if you ask me, because...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Because I\\'m getting closer to the truth, right?\\n▶ **Sparkle:** ...Oh?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Why else do you think I\\'m handing out cheap trinkets all over the streets, Fool?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** All part of the act. Fool\\'s bait. The more pathetic I seem, the more likely you\\'ll come sniffing around. So. Now that I\\'ve drawn you out, will you reward me with an answer for my efforts?\\n▶ **Sparkle:** Why should I help you?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Don\\'t you want to see Penacony descend into chaos? Well, I can make it happen. I just need an answer to one question: Back then, when you asked me to find a \"mute\"...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Did you really mean Robin?\\n▶ **Sparkle:** ...\\n▶ **Sparkle:** ...And what if I say \"no\"?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Then I\\'ll thank you. The word \"no\" has never sounded so pleasing.\\n▶ **Sparkle:** Well done. I admit I underestimated you, but what difference would it make?\\n▶ **Sparkle:** Let me tell you something. There were two mutes, but one is dead now,\\\\[Note 1] and the other... Though \"she\" is still in Penacony, I\\'m afraid you\\'ll never find \"her\" again.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Now I\\'m completely sure that I was on the right track from the beginning and never strayed, Fool.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Right now, there are only two things missing from my grasp: The meaning behind the truth and the means to expose it.\\n▶ **Sparkle:** How impressive! That\\'s quite a fancy way of saying \"I haven\\'t learned anything so far.\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Not exactly. I\\'ve gathered enough clues to prove its existence, and that\\'s enough for me. As for the answers to my questions, I\\'ll find them within seventeen... no, sixteen system hours.\\n▶ **Sparkle:** Oh, really? \"Only\" sixteen system hours? Well, let me lend you a hand.\\n\\n▶ **Sparkle:** Here you go. This is my precious \"Mutually Assured Destruction\" button, and I have one just like it. When either of us presses it, the other and the whole of Penacony will go up in smoke.\\n▶ **Sparkle:** If you\\'re really so desperate for the IPC to take over Penacony... blowing up the chessboard isn\\'t a bad idea. Start from scratch! That\\'s where the IPC excels, right?\\n▶ **Sparkle:** Just press the button when you\\'re at your wit\\'s end. And of course, feel free to reach out to me for my \"hospice care\" too!\\n▶ **Aventurine:** A deadly button, huh?... I guess The Family didn\\'t take your threats seriously at all? Otherwise, how on earth did you manage to bring it in here?\\n▶ **Sparkle:** I have my own ways. That\\'s all you need to know.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I\\'m afraid I\\'ll have to decline your offer. Who knows if your little gadget will actually work? By the way, I have no plans to search for the other mute friend you speak of, but it\\'s good to hear that he\\'s still here in Penacony.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I\\'ll handle the rest myself. I\\'ll orchestrate a grand finale for the downfall of The Family. And at the climax, the walls will crumble, people will wake up, and those who couldn\\'t speak will find their voices again...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** When that time comes, go ahead and press the button, and light up the sky with a magnificent fireworks display for me. Catch you later, Fool.\\n▶ **Sparkle:** You\\'re still talking big... But sure, if that happens, I\\'ll stay true to my word.\\n▶ **Sparkle:** Just don\\'t let me down now, okay?\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nMedia:Trailblaze Mission Heaven is a Place on Earth.mp4   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...\\n▶ **Indifferent Male:** So, No. 35, you\\'re back.

I didn\\'t give you permission to speak, you Sigonian hound.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...\\n▶ **Indifferent Male:** The guys in black didn\\'t say much, so I\\'ve no idea what you did to save your skin in that massacre back in the day.\\n▶ **Indifferent Male:** But I figured you must have had good luck, so I bought you. From now on, you and your good luck are MY assets. Are we clear?\\n▶ **Indifferent Male:** Your first task is simple. In addition to you, I\\'ve purchased thirty... well, thirty\\\\-four other slaves.\\n▶ **Indifferent Male:** Go and play a \"game\" with them. If you come out alive after two days, it proves that you\\'re the real deal.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...You\\'re insane.\\n▶ **Indifferent Male:** Heh, testing out if you\\'re a good product.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Aren\\'t you worried that the money you spent on me will go to waste?\\n▶ **Indifferent Male:** I\\'ve got stacks on stacks, blondie. The slave market is never short of self\\\\-righteous brats like you.\\n▶ **Indifferent Male:** But you look good, and that\\'s why many customers are betting their fortunes on a scrawny brat like you. So, go along now, and don\\'t let your master down.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...How much did you spend?\\n▶ **Indifferent Male:** What?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** My price. How much did you pay for me?\\n▶ **Indifferent Male:** Huh, you really want to know? Well, it was sixty TanbaRed Copper Coins. No more, no less.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...I\\'ll take my chances.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Thirty Tanba... If I come back alive, you\\'ll give me thirty Tanba. Deal?\\n▶ **Indifferent Male:** Hahaha, are you trying to strike a bet with me? Well, you\\'ve got some guts!\\n▶ **Indifferent Male:** Sorry, but that won\\'t do. Don\\'t forget your place, slave. You\\'re not qualified to be at the table.\\n▶ **Indifferent Male:** You\\'re just a chip, a life thrown away in someone else\\'s hands. Either you come back with more chips for your master, or... you never come back.\\n▶ **Indifferent Male:** It\\'s all or nothing.

As a servant, you should not resist your master... Yet you went and killed that man anyway.\\n▶ **Jade:** No lawyer has the audacity to defend you, perhaps you ought to represent yourself?\\n▶ **Kakavasha:** Not difficult. But definitely pointless.\\n▶ **Jade:** You\\'re pretty confident on your eloquence. Did you also think that when you lied to the Intelligentsia Guild?\\n▶ **Kakavasha:** Ask and you shall receive.

It was just a small wager.\\n▶ **Kakavasha:** If your luck holds out, the IPC will dig something up from the golden sands of Egyhazo, maybe even the Sand King\\'sTayzzyronth remains.

You will receive no charity on Penacony, and relying on your own strength alone to topple high walls...? Not a likely feat.\\n▶ **???:** Which is why once you step into the hotel, you remove your high hat and beg everyone you come across for help, like a hyena scavenging for scraps in the desert. Because you know that opportunities are fleeting.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** When you put it like that, even Ratio\\'s \"Attini Peacock\" analogy sounds pleasant.\\n▶ **???:** You know how rare it is for me to give you the straight dope, so listen while you can.\\n▶ **???:** It\\'s good timing that you mentioned the doctor. I\\'m especially fond of what you and he have in common, the conspiracies... calculations... especially the part about the finale, a magnificent act of betrayal!\\n▶ **???:** ...When everyone thinks this way, who would even suspect that it was another trap you\\'ve meticulously devised?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...\\n▶ **???:** Go on. Tell me I\\'m right. You know who you really are, Mr. Cavalier Gambler: Uptight, overcautious, massive inferiority complex. You\\'ve won so much, and you\\'re still SO afraid of losing.\\n▶ **???:** They only see your big bets, your bravado, the full house, the straight flush. They don\\'t know the other hand is below the table, clutching your chips for dear life.\\n▶ **???:** It\\'s a heck of an act. No wonder the tavern sent you an invite. You\\'re a natural, kid. You don\\'t stop at fooling the audience — you fool yourself too.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** The best way to prevent others from seeing your true colors, is first being able to fool yourself.\\n▶ **???:** Haha, of course, I know you all too well... But, it\\'s strange — why did you decline that invitation? You had the chance to embrace Elation. Was that not what you most wanted? But you chose the IPC instead...\\n▶ **???:** For the Preservation? Hmph, I doubt it. Do you even have anything in common with the Preservation?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I thought you knew...

I\\'ve got to give it to you, I\\'ve heard a lot of baloney, but that lie deserves a prize for sheer nerve.

That\\'s why Ratio\\'s betrayal was one of the keys to your plan. I have to say, that doctor\\'s acting was superb.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Or maybe he wasn\\'t acting at all?\\n▶ **???:** All the better for you!\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n▶ **???:** Sunday didn\\'t become head of the Oak Family by acting sloppy. He\\'s obsessed with control. You have to give him enough detail to satisfy his meticulous nature, but not so much that he gets suspicious.\\n▶ **???:** ...Which is why you had Ratio seek him out and leak the plan on purpose — to prevent the other party from suspecting anything. The intel you gave to Ratio was all true, and he spoke the same to Sunday.\\n▶ **???:** Finally, Sunday took the baittopaz, found the other cornerstone, and before you know it...\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **???:** ...Everyone\\'s distracted enough for you to steal the third stoneaventurine, right out from under them.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Why don\\'t you stop rummaging through my mind.\\n▶ **???:** Your mind?

You can\\'t even fool yourself. You just got lucky this time.\\n▶ **???:** This is the other cornerstone in Sunday\\'s hands. A rather beautiful green, just like you, smooth and cunning...\\n▶ **???:** Tell me, what\\'s its name?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Why are you even asking me?\\n▶ **???:** Ugh, must I do all the work? Aventurine is the stone of luck and trickery... That\\'s what she said when you received the stone, wasn\\'t it?\\n▶ **???:** This type of stone isn\\'t rare, but its hue is very similar to a certain gem. In fact, it\\'s often used as a substitutecounterfeit. And that more precious gem is...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Jade.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Even Sunday can\\'t tell the difference. It looks like jade can be substituted for aventurine, too. Sauce for the goose...\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n▶ **???:** Aventurine, Topaz, Jade...

Hah, we\\'ll find out soon enough.\\n▶ **???:** So, where\\'s the real aventurine stone? Take it out. Let\\'s have a look.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Heh, suddenly you don\\'t know where it is?\\n▶ **???:** I just want to hear you say it... After all, it really does resemble its owner.\\n\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...As you wish then. **They** never went anywhere. They\\'re right where they belong...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Piled up with these cheap baubles.\\n▶ **???:** You smashed the aventurine stone before you left...?\\n▶ **???:** ...Just look at it, tsk. Shattered, just like your life. Poor thing. A humble pebble coated in the most lustrous sheen. I take it back, this thing is far more precious than your life.\\n▶ **???:** You\\'re absolutely clear about the consequences of doing this? Blasphemy against Qlipoth\\'s bodyCornerstone. You think the IPC will let you get off scot\\\\-free?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Diamond has always been all about results. As long as I can create value far beyond the cost, the ends justify the means.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** How else would The Family be fooled if there was no price to pay? It doesn\\'t matter — even smashed to smithereens, the Preservation\\'s cornerstone can still be used. Its effect may be greatly diminished, but... it\\'s enough for me.\\n▶ **???:** Now I\\'m really curious. Why does every step you take involve reckless risks, and the choices you prepare for yourself always come with a strong impulse for self\\\\-destruction?\\n▶ **???:** Do you truly believe that the greater the risk, the greater the rewards? I wouldn\\'t have guessed you\\'d be so loyal to the IPC.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Hmph, there is so much you don\\'t see...

Surprisingly, there\\'s also a Galaxy Ranger among your ranks who has been cleared of suspicion — Acheron.  \\nBased on a comprehensive assessment of information from various sources, you confirm that The Family is indeed hiding a terrifying truth.

Hello, I\\'m Himeko, the Astral Express\\' navigator.\\n▶ ▶ **March 7th:** Hello, I\\'m March 7th!

None of you seem surprised by my arrival.\\n▶ **Himeko:** Since Welt has decided to travel with you, it means that he trusts you, and we trust his judgment.\\n▶ **Acheron:** I envy your close friendships.\\n▶ **Welt:** Miss Acheron here doesn\\'t present a danger, and she\\'s of no threat to the Astral Express. Aventurine\\'s prior accusation was based on nothing more than his own subjectivity.\\n▶ **Welt:** Which is why, before we continue working together, he has a duty to explain himself.\\n▶ **Himeko:** You want to... create a situation where all three parties are present?\\n▶ **Welt:** There must be some deeper meaning behind Aventurine\\'s actions. I suspect he\\'s been aware of Penacony\\'s secret from the beginning... and has been continuously strategizing to unveil it.\\n▶ **Welt:** In that sense, the Astral Express\\' role in his plans would be imperative. In the worst case scenario... he may use us to do something unexpected.\\n▶ **Welt:** Assuming things do escalate to that stage, having an extra ally is a good insurance policy. Penacony has numerous factions, and the state of affairs is significantly more intricate than that of Belobog and the Xianzhou.\\n But we must mete out justice for the dead.\\n▶ ▶ **March 7th:** (Trailblazer) is right. No matter what, we cannot ignore the safety of Penacony.\\n Maybe we should now get outta here while we still can?\\n▶ ▶ **March 7th:** (Trailblazer) also makes a good point.

No matter what, we can\\'t ignore the safety of Penacony.\\n▶ **Himeko:** To solve the mystery of the Watchmaker, it is crucial to get the IPC\\'s intel.

The entire theme park will be reduced to a shattered dream. Then, before The Family can even react, I\\'ll become the IPC fleet\\'s navigator.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Your bluff isn\\'t fooling anyone. If you could really do that, you would have done so earlier.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** You wanna bet? Sure, I\\'ll bet with you. I\\'m betting that it\\'ll be a sweeping victory for me, by detonating an unprecedented explosion to prove that the vow of Harmony is a complete and utter joke.\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...You won\\'t do it.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Of course I can.

Even if there were one or two murders on Penacony, most people wouldn\\'t be personally affected — and that won\\'t create any waves.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** This dreamMemory Zone of theirs isn\\'t a boundless sea, it\\'s a lonely island. The Family used the Harmony to build a high wall and isolate them from the vast and treacherous ocean of the outside world.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** That barrier they built \"keeps death out,\" but it also keeps the secrets that are lost in that watery abyss from floating to the surface. In a beautiful dream, free of suffering, who would want to go fishing for those secrets. No one. Unless...\\n▶ **Acheron:** Unless someone goes to the other side of the barrier...\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...And lives to tell the tale.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Someone already has.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I got the idea early on, chewing on that Masked Fool\\'s little hint. If a mute isn\\'t \"someone who cannot make a sound,\" then it has to be \"someone who cannot speak.\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Someone who survived the treacherous depths, but is unable to take the stage and speak the truth. I\\'m happy to know she\\'s safe and sound, and still on Penacony.\\n▶ **Acheron:** \"Hint\" ...is that not \"proof\"?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Proof is the one thing I don\\'t have. The only thing that can prove these... conjectures... is for The Family to come clean. And with the way they buttered up these outsiders, it seems pretty clear they\\'re intent on covering their tracks.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** But you don\\'t need proof to have a suspicion, and for me suspicion is enough. I didn\\'t need to find the memory zone meme. I just needed for someone to kill me like it killed the silver\\\\-haired girl.\\n▶ **Acheron:** You don\\'t sound very confident to me. Going out of your way to make citywide broadcasts in an attempt to involve more people... You are simply betting on the possibility of someone being able to \"break down the barrier.\"\\n▶ **Acheron:** You\\'re very lucky that fate has decided to let us cross paths. I happen to be equipped with a very sharp blade — sharp enough to slice through the veil of dreams. I can also carve the Harmony\\'s brand off of you...\\n▶ **Acheron:** You possess great cunning. Deliberately setting us up to be on opposing sides, constantly repeating the words of the Emanator in front of others, leaving me no choice but to draw my blade against you.\\n▶ **Acheron:** And that\\'s how you win. Opportunity and strategy, both are essential.\\n▶ **Acheron:** And in your plans, the IPC always wins. Even if you lose the bet... To The Family, the life of an ambassador is still invaluable.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** It\\'s a huge gamble, isn\\'t it? But, allow me to point out a mistake: The IPC\\'s success is not guaranteed — I unfortunately have no contingencies for such an important matter.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Detonating a Stellaron... I can\\'t do it. The aventurine stone is too broken to even safeguard my escape from the stage.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** If at the end of the day you did not unsheathe your blade... I would have lost the bet.\\n▶ **Acheron:** It is pointless to discuss \"what\\\\-ifs.\" You have won. Your prize is an entry ticket into that deep sea.\\n▶ **Acheron:** And after this, whether you can return from the abyss... is another gamble of yours.\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...Have you never wavered?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Wavered? Of course I have. But I can only bank on my own good fortune.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Because other than that, I have nothing.\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...Wake up from this dream and go to where you should be. Your gamble... is not over yet.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Before we part, can you answer one more question? As someone who has traveled on that road, can you tell me...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Why are we born into this world if it\\'s just to die?\\n▶ **Acheron:** I don\\'t think this, and never have. Nor do you.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** But the Nihility envelops you and I... and everyone.\\n▶ **Acheron:** And because of that, it\\'s pointless.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** But it is still there.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** If the dice of fate are always weighted, then that is our destiny. Why then... do we struggle against it?\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...My answer might not be able to resolve your confusion, because it has been with you throughout your journey, and is already a part of your life.\\n▶ **Acheron:** But you said, \"Sleep is the rehearsal of death,\" so why does life slumber? Because we are not ready for the final rest.\\n▶ **Acheron:** So you can definitely understand, why we **want** to be prepared.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Even if the ending has been predetermined, that\\'s fine. There are countless things that humans cannot change.\\n▶ **Acheron:** But before the end, there are many things that humans can do while on their journey.\\n▶ **Acheron:** And because of this, the \"end\" will thus reveal a completely different meaning.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Take a good look at your pocket. Your friend has already given you the answer.\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...Good luck.\\n\\n(Quick Read)\\n\\n**Doctor\\'s Advice**\\nThe impossible in the Dreamscape is not \"Death,\" but rather \"Dormancy.\"  \\nDo stay alive. I wish you the best of luck.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Then I shall get going.\\n▶ **\"Kakavasha\":** Mister...\\n▶ **\"Kakavasha\":** You\\'re leaving? You ultimately chose to... leave this Dreamscape?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Yes. Because they are not here...

A very, very distant place.\\n▶ **\"Kakavasha\":** Then are you going too?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I\\'ll get there, one day.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** But not now.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** There will come a day when the sky will drizzle, and I will hear the call of Gaiathra Triclops and know that it is time for me to go and be reunited with my family.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** So until the time comes... I should be preparing.\\n▶ **\"Kakavasha\":** Preparing for what?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Preparing to face them, Kakavasha, and to make them proud.\\n▶ **\"Kakavasha\":** ...\\n▶ **\"Kakavasha\":** I know you\\'ll be able to do it. Good luck!\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Of course.

Lunatic.\\n▶ **Gallagher:** You — The Family — you broke my spine and pulled out my fangs, and now you want to accuse me of murder? Ridiculous, only idiots who\\'ve drunk too much SoulGlad will berate a stray dog on the streets.\\n▶ **Gallagher:** What exactly is making you say all this nonsense? You should be more concerned about the outworld visitors who are making a scene in the theme park than me!\\n▶ **Sunday:** I don\\'t need you to remind me. The moment that ambassador walked out the doors of the mansion, I knew what he was trying to do. My **servants** see everything.

I\\'ll let it go this time, but this won\\'t happen again.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Very well, the Charmony Festival is about to commence soon. Take advantage of this unique opportunity, a blend of work and play is essential for superior knowledge absorption.\\n How do you rate Aventurine?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** The executives of the IPC and the Guild say that we are strategic partners. Yet, from my perspective, I am invariably the teacher, and he, along with you and every other individual, is the student.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** From this perspective, Aventurine isn\\'t what you\\'d call an ideal student, yet he\\'s also not utterly obtuse. Alas, the void within him can never be filled by talent and knowledge. Let\\'s hope he doesn\\'t turn into a philosophical zombie.\\n I thought you were going to make me get my act together.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Ah, saying such a thing merely indicates that you have not truly grasped the essence of learning.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** The principle of balancing work and relaxation is scientifically grounded, with the relevant proof process detailed on page 21 of the 31467th issue of the academic journal *Starseizer*. Acquiring knowledge aims to enhance living. Don\\'t invert priorities like those dolts at the Guild.\\n I hope you have fun at the festival.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Hmph, then you\\'ll excuse me.\\n(Talk to Dr. Ratio again, optional)\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** I detest noisy gatherings, as they intrude upon my thoughts... What a waste of time.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Talk to Topaz and Numby, optional)\\n▶ ▶ **Topaz:** Well if it isn\\'t (Trailblazer)? It hasn\\'t been long, and yet here we are again. How are you?\\n▶ **Numby:** Oink... oink!\\n Life is as wonderful as ever.\\n▶ **Topaz:** Hah, that\\'s what I thought! I heard you guys pulled off a big stunt, cutting down the Oak Family in one fell swoop.\\n▶ **Topaz:** Such a pity I couldn\\'t be there, or else I would have lent a helping hand.\\n Dead tired.\\n▶ **Topaz:** Hah, that\\'s what I thought! I heard you guys pulled off a big stunt, cutting down the Oak Family in one fell swoop.\\n▶ **Topaz:** Such a pity I couldn\\'t be there, or else I would have lent a helping hand.\\n I\\'m in the mood for a job change.\\n▶ **Topaz:** Hmm? So direct. Aren\\'t you afraid I might take you seriously?\\n▶ **Topaz:** Thinking about it though, the lives of the Nameless are so excessively exciting. I heard you guys pulled off a big stunt, cutting down the Oak Family in one fell swoop.\\n▶ **Topaz:** If one day you\\'re tired and looking for a change in work environment or you want a desk job, just contact me!\\n▶ **Topaz:** Look at how bustling this ship is, not bad! Someday when I\\'m less tied up, I plan to host a grand party on my eco\\\\-ship, and you\\'ll all be on the guest list.\\n I wanna ask you a question about that transform...\\n ...Are you also able to transform yourself?\\n▶ **Topaz:** Trans... form? What are you saying?\\n▶ **Topaz:** Oh... I understand now. You\\'re referring to Aventurine\\'s Cornerstone right? Sorry, compared to him, my ability is not as \"visual.\"\\n▶ **Topaz:** Guess there\\'s no harm telling you. The abilities of the Ten Stonehearts\\' cornerstones are all different. Some can even read your thoughts, grasp your desires...

Someday when I\\'m less tied up, I plan to host a grand party on my eco\\\\-ship, and you\\'ll be on the guest list.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Talk to Jade, optional)\\n▶ ▶ **Jade:** Hey there, lively (guy/lady)! Welcome to the Bonajade Exchange.\\n▶ **Jade:** What should I call you?\\n My name is (Trailblazer).\\n▶ **Jade:** What a unique name.\\n▶ ▶ **Jade:** So, (Mr./Miss) (Trailblazer), what do you wish for? And what are you willing to sacrifice for it?\\n My name is March 7th.\\n▶ **Jade:** No problem. Let\\'s just use this name.\\n▶ ▶ **Jade:** So, (Mr./Miss) March 7th — What do you wish for? And what are you willing to sacrifice for it?\\n My name is... Sunday.\\n▶ **Jade:** Hmm... Not a bad name, just lacking in virtue.\\n▶ ▶ **Jade:** So, (Mr./Miss) Sunday, what do you wish for? And what are you willing to sacrifice for it?\\n Make Nanook bow down to me!\\n I want to be the CEO of the IPC!\\n Revive Akivili!\\n▶ **Jade:** Oh... This is your wish?\\nLady Bonajade doesn\\'t even blink. You\\'re guessing she doesn\\'t have any sense of humor.\\n▶ **Jade:** Sounds simple enough. Very pragmatic. Then, let\\'s discuss the cost.\\n I\\'m listening...\\n No way. This is the endgame already?\\n▶ **Jade:** I wouldn\\'t be too worried.\\n▶ **Jade:** To fulfill this wish, the thing I need is simple: The tail of an animal.\\n Sounds easy enough.\\n What animal?\\n▶ **Jade:** Well, it\\'s a two\\\\-legged animal... With black fur, a round head, and long ears, it\\'s omnivorous and is prone to mood swings. Most importantly, it has mastered the human language and can communicate.\\n▶ **Jade:** Bring its tail to me as collateral and your dreams will come true.\\nIt seems that \"Lady Bonajade\" is not without a sense of humor... You have to admit, her skill in using dark humor is superior to yours.\\n...Hopefully, there are scissors on the Express.\\n▶ ▶ **Jade:** May fate bring us together again, (Mr./Miss) (Trailblazer).\\n(Talk to Jade again, optional)\\n▶ ▶ **Jade:** May fate bring us together again, (Mr./Miss) (Trailblazer).\\nLady Bonajade stares at you, seemingly piercing through all your desires and thoughts.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Talk to Argenti, optional)\\n▶ **Argenti:** We meet again, my dear friend. Your journey of the Beauty is even more elegant than mine. My most sincere regards to you!\\n Sincere regards to you too, dear friend.\\n▶ **Argenti:** Even after achieving such remarkable feats, you remain humble and gentle... Such is the true mark of knightly grace!\\n You flatter me too much...\\n▶ **Argenti:** How could it be? The Beauty holds no bias. My words are fair and just.\\n When will I be able to unlock a new Path then?\\n▶ **Argenti:** Unlock? An eloquent and picturesque choice of words, yet you have already set forth on the Path of Beauty\\n▶ **Argenti:** I have heard of your valiant deed in leading others to vanquish the Omen of Evil. Though the tale bears a tinge of regret, you have undoubtedly championed Beauty and justice. May Idrila smile upon you.\\n The Omen of Evil?\\n▶ **Argenti:** If an admirer of the Beauty gets lost in the pursuit of power, they risk descending into \"the Omen of Evil,\" a form which is neither human nor beast.\\n▶ **Argenti:** Although Mr. Sunday did not cross paths with the Path of Beauty, his actions were no different from the Omen of Evil. A lamentable soul lost on the path of righteousness... truly a matter of deep regret.\\n Why were you not there during the final battle?\\n▶ **Argenti:** I\\'m ashamed to admit, Ena\\'s dream was too realistic. I couldn\\'t bear to bid farewell to a fallen friend, who had long turned into a beast. I lingered in that illusory dream for far too long... Ah, his voice and smile were too vivid.\\n▶ **Argenti:** I didn\\'t pass the trial of Beauty this time, spending much time in self\\\\-reflection over my own hesitation. Yet I wish for Idrila to remain my beacon, a banner for me to strengthen my determination for the Beauty.\\n I hope you have fun at the festival.\\n▶ **Argenti:** Thank you, and may the Beauty always be with you!\\n(Talk to Argenti again, optional)\\n▶ **Argenti:** Thank you, and may the Beauty always be with you!\\n\\n### Wait for the opening of the Charmony Festival\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nJust as you are about to take a seat, a familiar voice grabs hold of your attention — it\\'s Firefly.  \\nShe seems to have something to say to you...

I knew I didn\\'t get the wrong person.\\n You saw me?\\n▶ **Firefly:** Yes, it\\'s just I didn\\'t get the chance to say hello. There\\'s still some time before Charmony Festival starts. Do you want to chat?\\n You mistook some else for me?\\n▶ **Firefly:** It was you. I saw you opening treasure chests, hitting balloons, and playing the Dreamy Slots. I don\\'t think I\\'m mistaken... right?\\n▶ **Firefly:** There\\'s still some time before Charmony Festival starts. Do you want to chat?\\n**You walk and talk with Firefly, stopping in your tracks when more comes into view.**\\n▶ **Firefly:** ...Two murder cases, a showdown with the IPC\\'s ambassadors, the legacy of the Nameless, and a remnant of the Order who wishes to replace an Aeon\\\\-created paradise with a dream — you guys even ended up shattering the dream... It\\'s truly been quite a vacation.\\n▶ **Firefly:** It\\'s a good thing that you guys managed to overcome all those difficult problems. Congratulations! After the Charmony Festival\\'s opening, will you guys be leaving again?\\n I don\\'t know where our next destination will be.\\n I\\'m not sure if we\\'ll be able to depart smoothly.\\n▶ **Firefly:** There will always be somewhere. After all, you guys are on the Path of the Trailblaze...\\n▶ **Firefly:** Before joining the Stellaron Hunters, Elio told me that this journey will tell me how to live on. That\\'s all he said. As for the rest, it\\'s up to me to find out.\\n▶ **Firefly:** So, I\\'ll pay extra attention to any leads that will let me live on. This trip to Penacony is no different.\\n No wonder you were interested in investigating the Watchmaker.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Yes... sadly I was looking in the wrong place. But I did reap some rewards.\\n Looks like you didn\\'t get what you wanted this time.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Yes... Initially, I thought that the answer might lie with the riddle of the Watchmaker. I was looking in the wrong place, but I did reap some rewards.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Do you know Miss Jade from the IPC\\'s Strategic Investment Department? Bonajade Exchange belongs to her.\\n▶ **Firefly:** She told me her price, but...\\n Did you take the deal?\\n▶ **Firefly:** No. But what she wanted wasn\\'t my answer either.\\n Don\\'t take the deal. Those IPC people may have ulterior motives.\\n▶ **Firefly:** I know. But what she wanted wasn\\'t my answer either.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Of course I want to live on, but... what fate owes me, I want it paid back, not passed on. No one else should be involved, because this is a grudge between me and fate.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Ah, speaking of which... Actually, I feel that I still owe you a formal apology, for... that matter with \"the performer of the Iris Family.\"\\n▶ ▶ **Firefly:** Even the smallest of lies can turn into a betrayal as sharp as a blade... I\\'m sorry, (Trailblazer).\\n I never felt hurt by this.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Really? Then it seems... what Kafka taught me was correct.\\n No problem. You\\'ve already apologized.\\n▶ **Firefly:** It was an emergency, so I never had the chance to formally apologize to you, and admittedly, I was the one to blame.\\n You shouldn\\'t have lied to me in the beginning.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Yes, and for that, I\\'m sorry.\\n▶ **Firefly:** To me, hiding is much easier than being honest... yet, I still want to try expressing my emotions as any ordinary person would...\\n▶ **Composed Bloodhound Family Member:** It\\'s that girl! Get moving! Arrest that criminal before the Charmony Festival\\'s opening ceremony starts!\\n▶ **Firefly:** I can\\'t believe they\\'ve chased me this far... Looks like we\\'ll have to say our goodbyes. Don\\'t worry about me. Just go and enjoy the ceremony!\\n▶ **Firefly:** The \"script\" hasn\\'t reached its end yet — we will meet again!\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (I hope she\\'s okay... But if it\\'s only those two Hounds again, she\\'ll probably be fine.)\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (I\\'ll send a message later to check in on her.

Firstly, on behalf of the Penacony Family\\'s five major lineages...\\n▶ **Robin:** And on behalf... of myself, I\\'d like to extend a warm welcome to all our guests!\\n▶ **Robin:** As you all may have noticed, this year\\'s Charmony Festival is far from regular. Thanks to the efforts of everyone, this celebration is unprecedented in scale, with factions from across the cosmos in attendance...\\n▶ **Robin:** Not only that, the customary opening ceremony held at the Penacony Grand Theater has now moved to the Radiant Feldspar — the very airship you all stand upon.\\n▶ **Robin:** We invite you to express your warmest applause and deepest appreciation for Oti Alfalfa — head of the Alfalfa Family — for his selfless devotion to the Harmony\\'s cause!\\n▶ **Robin:** What makes this festival so uniquely significant? As is widely known, the Radiant Feldspar had to halt its voyage due to an anomaly in the sweet dream, sparking widespread discussion in the Twelve Hours...\\n▶ **Robin:** But thanks to the hard work of Penacony\\'s internal and external factions, we\\'ve finally gotten the Dreamscape back on track, just in time for the Charmony Festival. And as they say, good things come in pairs. The Charmony Festival not only celebrates this achievement but also marks the relaunch of the Radiant Feldspar.\\n▶ **Robin:** And finally, the last reason. Does everyone remember the Watchmaker? In truth, The Family has poured their efforts into this festival just to commemorate this legendary luminary...\\n▶ **Robin:** The father of Penacony, Mikhail Char Legwork, one of the legendary Nameless who laid the foundations of Penacony!\\n▶ **Robin:** In the most bewildering times of the Planet of Festivities, it was he who descended from the sky with his companions, who taught us through Trailblazing where freedom lies. It was also they who led the vanguard in the pioneering of the Dreamscape, in exchange for what is now known as the paradise of Harmony.\\n▶ **Robin:** It can be said that Penacony\\'s splendid success today is deeply rooted in the Trailblazing ethos the Watchmaker planted within us. Only by honoring this Trailblazing spirit can we fulfill our mission and spread Harmony to a broader audience.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Aww... That\\'s so nice of her. She\\'s talking about us!\\n We haven\\'t even been mentioned yet...\\n▶ **March 7th:** Oh, come on! It doesn\\'t matter if she\\'s talking about the old or new generation, we\\'re all still a part of the Astral Express family!\\n Our Trailblazing spirit is unparalleled!\\n▶ **March 7th:** That\\'s right! Unparalleled!\\n The Express crew would\\'ve been disbanded long ago if it weren\\'t for you!\\n▶ **March 7th:** Obviously! Wait! Why does that seem so ominous...\\n▶ **Robin:** And now the sweet dream is back on track, all thanks to the Trailblaze, of course. If it weren\\'t for everyone on the Astral Express, we wouldn\\'t be able to successfully host this Charmony Festival.\\n▶ **Robin:** Thus, with unanimous consent from the five major lineages, Penacony\\'s Family — on behalf of all family members throughout the cosmos, offer a token of appreciation to the Nameless.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Oooh... I wonder if it\\'s gonna be a big one?!\\n▶ **Robin:** ...We will transfer ownership of the Radiant Feldspar to the Astral Express! A meager appreciation that we hope you will accept with grace.\\n▶ **Robin:** Let us gift our applause and cheers to these brave and dauntless Nameless!\\n▶ **Guests:** Nameless! Nameless! Nameless!\\n▶ **Robin:** And now, I propose a toast...\\n▶ **Robin:** To Harmony, to the Trailblaze, to the future of Penacony and the universe, and to the generous Alfalfa Family Head, Mr. Oti Alfalfa...\\n▶ **Robin:** ...Cheers!\\n(A cutscene plays)\\n\\n**Old Oti:** To make a decision like that... This little bird is no less capable than her brother!\\n**Sparkle:** All\\'s well that ends well... right?\\n**Sparkle:** But have you forgotten someone, my gray\\\\-haired friend?\\n**Sparkle:** I put a bomb on this ship.\\n**Sparkle:** You have ten minutes to find it — better hurry!\\n\\n### Find the bombs based on \"Sparkle\\'s Wondrous Treasure Map\" (0/999\\\\)\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs expected, something unexpected happened during the opening of the Charmony Festival: That laughter\\\\-worshiping girl had painstakingly laid out buttons everywhere obviously for precisely this moment.  \\n999 imaginary neutron bombs... seriously, how on earth did she get her hands on so many weapons of mass destruction?

But it\\'s no problem — to ease any boredom during your wait, I can play a soothing song for you!\\n▶ **\"Fool\" Doll:** Now playing *Never Give Up, Never Surrender* by the trending superstar Ast Rickley from the Epsilon XII System...\\n▶ **\"Fool\" Doll:** ...Oh, hang on, Penacony\\'s Family have not purchased the rights to this song — we can\\'t play it here. How about this, I\\'ll recite it for you — next up, please enjoy a recital of *Never Give Up, Never Surrender*!\\n▶ **\"Fool\" Doll:** \"O Aha! If you ask me how I feel about you, don\\'t tell me that you pretend not to see!\"\\n▶ **\"Fool\" Doll:** \"THEY will never give you up, never make you sad! THEY will never give you up, never make you cry!\"\\n▶ **\"Fool\" Doll:** \"THEY will never say goodbye to you, never tell lies to hurt you — praise Aha!\"\\nAfter the almost tearful exclamation of \"Praise Aha!\" comes to pass, all that\\'s left in the doll\\'s mouth is that lingering echoes of an irritating cassette tape. Turns out that it isn\\'t a bomb after all, but a vintage tape recorder.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Investigate the \"Outlaw\" Doll)\\n▶ ▶ **\"Outlaw\" Doll:** Welcome to the Radiant Feldspar, good (sir/lady)! I am a dangerous bomb, and an outlaw who despises law and order. May you have a splendid day!\\n You\\'re pretty polite.\\n▶ ▶ **\"Outlaw\" Doll:** Thank you, (mister/miss), but courtesy doesn\\'t hide my hazardous lunacy. If you\\'re unconvinced, let me show you: Go fudge yourself, you muddle\\\\-fudger!\\n I\\'m guessing you\\'re also not a real bomb.\\n▶ **\"Outlaw\" Doll:** I\\'m not, but so what? I\\'m still crazy and dangerous. In case you don\\'t believe me, allow me to show you: Go fudge yourself, you muddle\\\\-fudger!\\n You don\\'t look or sound that dangerous.\\n▶ **\"Outlaw\" Doll:** Really? Fork you. If you think this isn\\'t intense enough, I don\\'t mind showing you what real danger and madness look like.\\n▶ **\"Outlaw\" Doll:** To be frank, I didn\\'t become an outlaw because I\\'m a fudgin\\' bomb. It\\'s because I\\'m the fudgin\\' owner of an ancient, mad, forbidden curse.\\n▶ **\"Outlaw\" Doll:** Care to experience it? I can chant it for you, but Miss Sparkle won\\'t be responsible for any of the consequences.\\n Let\\'s see what you\\'ve got!\\n▶ **\"Outlaw\" Doll:** Holy fudge, you\\'re more insane than I am! Let me gather my wits...\\n Forget it. I value my life too much.\\n▶ **\"Outlaw\" Doll:** Oh? You scared, lil\\' fudgehead? It\\'s too late, I tell you! You\\'ve already opened Pandora\\'s box...\\n▶ **\"Outlaw\" Doll:** ...The ritual is ready. Perk up your ears and listen closely to the most ancient, primal fear etched into the very fudgin\\' genes of humanity—\\n▶ **\"Outlaw\" Doll:** Bloomska, boomska, little sparkleeesss!!! Bloomska, boomska, little sparkleeesss!!!\\nThe striking resemblance to the voice of the legendary Penaconian cartoon character \"Clockie\" instantly rings an alarm within you! The profound muscle memory from ancient times prompts you to swing your arms in a wide arc, catapulting the doll into the heavens.\\nIf the doll\\'s words just now are not false, then indeed there won\\'t be an imaginary neutron bomb exploding on the surface at Golden Hour. No need to worry...?\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Investigate the \"Memey the Imp\" Doll)\\n▶ **\"Memey the Imp\" Doll:** Hello, human. We meet again. I never thought I\\'d see you here.\\n▶ **\"Memey the Imp\" Doll:** I\\'m currently on this luxury cruise ship enjoying Penacony\\'s consumer\\\\-friendly sugar\\\\-coated cannonballs. What about you? Are you just seeing the sights?\\n I\\'m here to defuse a bomb.\\n▶ **\"Memey the Imp\" Doll:** Bomb? Gosh, I\\'m not a bomb.\\n Have we met somewhere?\\n▶ **\"Memey the Imp\" Doll:** If you\\'ve been to the Xianzhou Luofu, it\\'s likely we\\'ve met.\\n You remind me of an old acquaintance.\\n▶ **\"Memey the Imp\" Doll:** Old acquaintance? I\\'m not even human.\\n▶ **\"Memey the Imp\" Doll:** I\\'m a heliobus, originally from the Luofu\\'s Fyxestroll Garden. I\\'m passionate about researching Xianzhou subcultures, but I\\'ve slowly come to realize that Xianzhou subcultures also have their limits.\\n▶ **\"Memey the Imp\" Doll:** I forgot what happened, but anyway, I ended up in Penacony. I wanted to study a subculture that is completely different from the Xianzhou\\'s, and boy it\\'s really been an eye\\\\-opening experience — that is, if I had eyes.\\n▶ **\"Memey the Imp\" Doll:** I\\'ve come to realize, the people here don\\'t treat subcultures as actual culture. They call them me... me...\\n Memes?\\n Mesmerizing antagonists?\\n▶ **\"Memey the Imp\" Doll:** Yes meme, that\\'s it. They even have forms. I\\'m good friends with a meme with sharp teeth and claws. It\\'s very interested in the Xianzhou Vidyadhara culture. I gave it a Xianzhou name, and it was delighted.\\n▶ **\"Memey the Imp\" Doll:** Oh, speaking of which, I should go and look for it. Memey the Monster has an explosive temper, and it\\'s never been very patient.\\n▶ **\"Memey the Imp\" Doll:** I hope you can find the real sugar\\\\-coated cannonball — I mean, bomb. Bye bye!\\nA wisp of green smoke emerges from the doll\\'s body, and then it lies motionless. It seems this isn\\'t a real imaginary neutron bomb either.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Investigate the \"Director\" Doll)\\n▶ **\"Director\" Doll:** Hello, lovely actor. You can call me the Director Doll. I often use this name in film credits.\\n▶ ▶ **\"Director\" Doll:** If you didn\\'t know, I\\'m the one who directed the entire farce in Penacony. As the leading (man/lady) of the show, what did you think? Feel free to share your thoughts...\\n▶ **\"Director\" Doll:** ...Well, actually, due to current plot requirements, you\\'re only allowed to say one line. So, please try and resist the urge to share your thoughts.\\n Right now, I just want to defuse the bomb and advance the plot.\\n▶ **\"Director\" Doll:** Really? You really have no questions? Okay then, what a pity.\\n You\\'re the one who made Sunday a villain?\\n▶ **\"Director\" Doll:** Sunday? Who\\'s that?\\n What about the action scene where Acheron had to escape The Family?\\n▶ **\"Director\" Doll:** Acheron? Who\\'s that?\\n What happened to Robin\\'s journey of uncovering the truth?\\n▶ **\"Director\" Doll:** Robin? Who\\'s that?\\n You have way too many storyline transitions!\\n▶ **\"Director\" Doll:** \\\\*sigh\\\\* It\\'s all my fault for being duped by the Masked Fools! This screenplay was written by someone named \"Miss Sparkle\". She said she graduated from Sparkle University\\'s Film Directing and Screenwriting program, so we instantly hit it off...\\n▶ **\"Director\" Doll:** ...Who knew that there was no such thing as the \"Film Directing and Screenwriting program\" at Sparkle University — in fact, Sparkle University isn\\'t even real! Bah, Sparkle.\\n▶ **\"Director\" Doll:** Since you\\'re done asking questions, and I\\'m done answering... according to the script, I must reveal to you the fact that there\\'s no bomb here at all, thus causing you to want to kick yourself for spending this whole time listening to me prattling on, after which we will part ways.\\n▶ **\"Director\" Doll:** But don\\'t fret! I\\'ve also prepared a gift for you — a dream bubble that has the thrilling life\\\\-and\\\\-death moments I shared with a beautiful Memokeeper! If you haven\\'t seen it yet, you should hurry up and look for Dr. Edward.\\nThe harmless chatterbox plush doll bows affectionately to you, blowing you a kiss before bounding away, vanishing into the depths of the cabin with joyful leaps.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Investigate the \"Origami\" Doll)\\n▶ **\"Origami\" Doll:** Yahaha! So you\\'ve found me... Uh, no, I meant to say \"thank you\", tweet!\\n You\\'re a bomb?\\n▶ **\"Origami\" Doll:** What... You can\\'t tell? I\\'m the Origami Doll, tweet!\\n Don\\'t speak out of turn.\\n▶ **\"Origami\" Doll:** I\\\\-I just got the parts mixed up! Please don\\'t tell anyone, tweet.\\n So you\\'re the Origami Bird now then?\\n▶ **\"Origami\" Doll:** Origami Bird? Can\\'t you tell? I\\'m the Origami Doll, tweet!\\n▶ **\"Origami\" Doll:** Actually, there are 998 more dolls that can pack a punch just like me on the Radiant Feldspar, tweet. Please call them back to the Golden Sparkle Tree. I will prepare a worthy gift for your troubles, tweet!\\n▶ **\"Origami\" Doll:** As for that imaginary neutron bomb you want... Uh, don\\'t interrupt me. I know you never mentioned those three words to me before... Well, the bomb isn\\'t here, tweet! I\\'m afraid you\\'ll have to look elsewhere for it.\\nThe peculiar doll flicks its twin ponytails and vanishes into the sky of dreamscape, a sight much more thrilling than an Origami Bird. As for the \"Golden Sparkle Tree\"... forget about it, most likely just some random balderdash that Sparkle made up.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Investigate the \"Furmur\" Doll)\\nThis \"Furmur\" doll is a Sparkle lookalike.\\nAccording to the book \"Compilation of Sparkle Vocabulary in Modern and Contemporary Times,\" the term \"furmur\" was first coined in 2005 AE on the Sparkle Planet in the Sparkle star system. Its original meaning is \"fluffy.\" Nowadays, the inhabitants of Sparkle Planet often use \"furmur\" specifically to refer to \"plush dolls.\"\\nIn other words, \"furmur doll\" translates to \"fluffy doll doll doll doll.\" It may sound peculiar, but considering its Sparkle origin, it actually makes lots of sense.\\nThe \"Furmur\" doll is staring right at you.\\n Can I dismantle your bomb?\\n Stare back.\\nThe \"Furmur\" doll continues to stare right at you.\\n Can you speak, please!?\\n Continue to stare back.\\nThe \"Furmur\" doll\\'s eyes never blink. Honestly, if they did, it would be quite unsettling.\\nAnyway, it\\'s just an ordinary plush toy. Can you really expect it to utter a single word?\\n If you don\\'t speak, then your silence equates to consent.\\n Keep staring at it.\\nIt must be pointed out that this doll has no suspicious features at all. It exudes from within an aura befitting of a \"Furmur\" doll, not that of an imaginary neutron bomb.\\n...which means there is no need to bother it anymore. It makes both you and the doll appear rather pitiful. It\\'s best to promptly put an end to this farce.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nMessages  \\n1111111111Black SwanThere\\'s progress with the bomb situationI\\'ve got good news and bad newsWhich one would you like first?Good news.(Trailblazer)The good news firstBlack SwanThe good news is, I\\'ve found 131 bombsThe bad news is, none of them are real bombsBad news.(Trailblazer)Tell me the bad newsBlack SwanThe bad news is, I\\'ve found 131 bombsThe good news is, none of them are real bombsYou\\'re in here too?(Trailblazer)???

Twenty\\\\-seven minutes fifty\\\\-one seconds...\\n▶ **Firefly:** The sweet dream has lost the protection of the Order — if it were to blow up here... the consequences would be unfathomable. I\\'ve scrutinized it for a long time, but the bomb\\'s design is incredibly unique, as if it\\'s been locked by some mysterious Path force...\\n▶ **Firefly:** Apart from its creator, I fear no one knows how to deactivate it.\\n Then we\\'ll just have to find that person!\\n▶ **Firefly:** It\\'s difficult. Time is running out, and she\\'s a master of disguise. And even if we catch her, she won\\'t come quietly...\\n(Return to previous dialogue options)\\n Don\\'t panic.

This allows me to perform feats that typical Dreamchasers can\\'t.\\n▶ **Firefly:** As long as I can bear the pain of the memoria pressure, I\\'ll be able to dive into the primal Memory Zone beyond the dream, and extend a lifeline to the Radiant Feldspar.\\n▶ **Firefly:** I will take this bomb into the depths of the DreamscapePrimordial Memory Zone... as deep as possible, where there are no living souls around. That way, at least no one will get hurt.\\n What about you?\\n Can you really make it in time?\\n This matter can\\'t just be left to the Stellaron Hunters.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Don\\'t worry. I believe that this Fyrefly ArmorS.A.M. will be enough to take me to where I need to go before the countdown ends... and maybe even make it back safely.\\n▶ **Firefly:** At present, this is our best, and most logical course of action. After all, a long story deserves a happy ending.\\n▶ **Firefly:** I have some words to share with you, though they were spoken to me by Miss Acheron. She said that \"The so\\\\-called impossible is merely something that has yet to happen...\"\\n▶ **Firefly:** At the moment, there are so many things that seem impossible... but are they really never going to happen? Maybe it\\'s just that the moment to disprove these \"impossibilities\" hasn\\'t arrived yet.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Whether it be a literal ending, suffering akin to death, or a harrowing deathscape... Before the appointed destination arrives, they are all the same, yet I can still make myriad choices. I also firmly believe that...\\n▶ **Firefly:** That when that moment arrives for us to make a choice, the answer to our end will already be within our hearts\\n▶ **Firefly:** It is not destiny that shapes us, but we who shape destiny.\\n(A cutscene plays)\\n\\n**Firefly:** The Astral Express and the Stellaron Hunters... are like light and shadow.\\n**Firefly:** We walk on different paths, intertwined, moving forward and growing together...\\n**Firefly:** Maybe the end is predestined, but... it is not today.\\n**\"True Bomb\" Doll:** Since things are going too well...\\n**\"True Bomb\" Doll:** Let\\'s speed up the countdown!\\n**Firefly:** Human life is short, just like fyreflies \\\\[*sic*] to a flame.

It seems some time has passed since the Harmonious Choir were defeated... What has happened during this time?  \\nYou hear a familiar voice approach from behind you. An irresistible force turns you on your heel as you (willingly) walk towards its source... After all, who can resist such a languid, elegant, and powerful Memokeeper? The Reverie (Reality)\\n\\n▶ **March 7th:** Wake up... Wake up...\\n▶ ▶ **March 7th:** ...Hey, (Trailblazer)! Wake up! The sun\\'s frying your butt!\\n▶ **March 7th:** Are you all right? Can you hear me? Do you remember your name?\\n I... don\\'t remember anything.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Not good. Try to remember. Your name is...\\n▶ **March 7th:** Alright, alright, stop joking around. The Lightning\\\\-Lord may be all\\\\-powerful, but they\\'re not going to cause sudden memory loss. I\\'m just glad you\\'re okay.\\n What happened while I was out?\\n Are we in the dream or reality?\\n Why does that line sound so familiar...\\n▶ **March 7th:** Hmm? It does? Well, doesn\\'t ring any bells to me.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Looks like your mind\\'s still in one piece, if you\\'re able to remember such details... Well that\\'s reassuring.\\n What happened while I was out?\\n Are we in the dream or reality?\\n Didn\\'t I shoot the sun out of the sky...\\n▶ **March 7th:** Uh... kind of, it was General Jing Yuan who helped us shoot it down.\\n▶ **March 7th:** In any case, since you remember what happened just now... Well, that\\'s put my mind at ease.\\n What happened while I was out?\\n Are we in the dream or reality?\\n▶ **March 7th:** Mm... It\\'s a long story. Simply put, Dan Heng used the jade abacus of allying oath when we were in the middle of a fierce battle, and summoned the general to help us just in time.\\n▶ **March 7th:** And then, we returned to reality. Look, this is your room.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Everyone else has also returned from the Dreamscape. Himeko and the rest are at the lobby discussing matters with the general. Now that you\\'re awake, we should tell the Crew that you\\'re all right. Come with me!\\n(Upon dialogue completion)\\n▶ ▶ **Black Swan:** Not going to come chat with me...

I noticed (Trailblazer) was awake and wanted to check to see how (he/she) was doing.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Though the strike from the General was timely, its destruction was also immense. When \"Emanators\" collide, ordinary people inevitably suffer.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** But luckily for them, the DreamscapeMemory Zone is my home turf. Thankfully, I managed to get everyone out before the Harmonious Choir collapsed.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Oh, so that\\'s what happened! Thank you, Miss Black Swan.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Don\\'t mention it, after all, I wouldn\\'t want to see such precious memories vanish. You\\'re heading to see your friends, aren\\'t you? Would it bother you if I walked with you for a short while?\\n▶ **March 7th:** Of course not... But you\\'re not planning on doing something like last time, are you?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Why would you think that? I\\'ve never harbored any ill intentions... well, not when you were around, anyway.\\n\\n### Head to the VIP Lounge Rest Area and find Dan Heng\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Mission Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs the dust settles, Asdana and the entire universe have escaped the fate of becoming puppets to the Order. It seems some time has passed since the Harmonious Choir were defeated... What has happened during this time?  \\nTake a look around The Reverie, regroup with your companions, and find out what\\'s been going on. The Reverie (Reality)\\n\\n(Upon dialogue completion)\\n▶ **March 7th:** Himeko and Mr. Yang are probably still busy... Let\\'s go look for Dan Heng first.\\n(Approach Boothill and Dan Heng)\\n▶ **March 7th:** Look, he\\'s still talking to that cowboy!\\n(Talk to Dan Heng)\\n▶ ▶ **Dan Heng:** You\\'re awake, (Trailblazer). How do you feel?\\n▶ **Boothill:** Well fork me! You must be that Stellaron they were talkin\\' about.\\n I\\'m fine. Thank you.\\n▶ ▶ **March 7th:** Don\\'t worry, (Trailblazer)\\'s been up and about for a while now. But hey, Dan Heng, why don\\'t you introduce this cowboy to (him/her) first?\\n Dan Heng, why do you have to blab about everything...?\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** I... didn\\'t mention anything to him.\\n▶ ▶ **Boothill:** Partner, you got it all wrong. I heard it straight from the Memokeeper.\\n Fork, huh? I myself prefer spooning.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Allow me to introduce him to you: This is Boothill, a Galaxy Ranger.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** During our pursuit of a certain person, we crossed paths and just so happened to uncover a shocking plot being concocted by Mr. Sunday...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Which is why we sought you out, to help the Astral Express save the world together.\\n▶ **Boothill:** No need for thanks! The Galaxy Rangers\\' principle is \"Correct every injustice one sees\". That\\'s how you lot on the Xianzhou put it, right, Dan Heng?\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** More or less.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Wait. Hold on a sec. This is the first time I\\'m hearing about this \"certain person\"... Who are you chasing, and why would that lead you to the Express?\\n▶ **Boothill:** Haha, good question! It\\'s...\\n▶ **Boothill:** ...\\n▶ **Boothill:** Who was it again? Uh, Dan Heng, do you remember?\\n Come on, don\\'t keep me in suspense.\\n IDK man you\\'re looking kinda sus...\\n▶ **Boothill:** Nah, that ain\\'t it. I just can\\'t seem to recall. Weird, my neuro chip hasn\\'t registered any malfunctions...\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** ...I can\\'t seem to remember either.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Uh... What\\'s going on?\\n▶ **Boothill:** Uh... heck, forget about it! If it\\'s slipped all our minds, reckon that person was just a minor scoundrel, unimportant. Ain\\'t gonna stop us from piecin\\' together the story anyhow.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** ...Yes, when the dust settles, I\\'ll just think of a way to recall it in the Memory Zone.\\n▶ ▶ **Black Swan:** Everyone, let\\'s hurry up and look for Miss Himeko, shall we? (Trailblazer)\\'s now a minor star on Penacony, and the entire hotel\\'s concerned about (his/her) well\\\\-being.\\n▶ **March 7th:** You\\'re right. Let\\'s head to the lobby then.\\n(Talk to Boothill, optional)\\n▶ **Boothill:** You guys go. I\\'m an outsider after all — I\\'d rather not disrupt a long\\\\-awaited reunion.\\n\\n### Regroup with Himeko and Welt\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs the dust settles, Asdana and the entire universe have escaped the fate of becoming puppets to the Order. It seems some time has passed since the Harmonious Choir were defeated... What has happened in this time?  \\nYou reunite with Dan Heng and meet a new friend: the Galaxy Ranger cowboy, Boothill. There was supposed to be an exchange of small talk here with lots of cheesy jokes and callbacks. However, as Himeko and Welt are still concerned about your well\\\\-being, this section of banter vanished into thin air. We hope for your understanding and patience in this matter. Parlor Car\\n\\n(Approach Himeko, Jing Yuan, and Welt)\\n▶ **March 7th:** Look, they\\'re with the General!\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** Heh, that\\'s alright. In these times of conflict, for the sake of utmost safety, it is only right that the Alliance steps forward to mediate on behalf of the Astral Express. We must not allow you to take unnecessary risks.\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** Furthermore, despite the IPC\\'s eagerness for success, it prioritizes \"peace\" above all, and The Family, trapped though it may be, professes a desire for \"Harmony.\" The Alliance has always won people over with reason. I firmly believe both parties can indeed put aside their differences and come to a peaceful agreement.\\n▶ **Himeko:** The general possesses a deep understanding of the greater good. With the Xianzhou Alliance mediating, peace for Penacony is within reach.\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** You flatter me! But ultimately, it\\'s been all down to the Express. Without your efforts, this Sweetdream Paradise would have been claimed by the last remnants of \"Order\" before there was even a shot at peace...\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** Well would you look at that. Here comes the big hero.\\n It was nothing, really.\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** Hahaha, here\\'s the Galactic Baseballer — the paragon of both heroism and humility!\\n I do what I can.\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** Hahaha, if it isn\\'t the Galactic Baseballer — a true hero who dares to take action!\\n Lemme guess, you were thinking about me... again?\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** Hahaha, if it isn\\'t the Galactic Baseballer — a hero with unparalleled insight!\\n▶ ▶ **Welt:** (Trailblazer), are you okay? I heard you couldn\\'t wake up. Are you feeling unwell?\\n▶ ▶ **March 7th:** Don\\'t worry, Mr. Yang. There\\'s nothing wrong with (him/her), (he/she) practically burned through a lifetime\\'s worth of jokes on the way here.\\n▶ **March 7th:** What about you, Mr. Yang? I heard that even Miss Robin wasn\\'t spared, and that guy locked you both up...\\n▶ **Welt:** It\\'s a long story... but, at least Mr. Sunday took it easy on us.\\n▶ **Welt:** He used an ability called \"tuning\" to connect our consciousnesses with his. In other words, he imprisoned us within his consciousness.\\n▶ **Welt:** Thanks to General Jing Yuan\\'s destruction of the Harmonious Choir, we were able to escape.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Ah, he used that \"tuning\" on us, too! Does that mean that we were almost imprisoned as well...?\\n▶ **Himeko:** I can confidently say now, he was truly after a fair fight with us. Had he wanted, he could have easily taken us down... without so much as lifting a finger.\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** Speaking of the Oak Family head... Where is he now?\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** It\\'s complicated, but in a nutshell, he\\'s now the former Oak Family head.\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** The IPC has named him the key figure in The Family\\'s Penacony split, citing a threat to Cosmic peace. He must represent The Family and answer for the unrest caused. His trial is set to take place at Pier Point.\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** The Family quickly labeled him and the remnants of the Order as enemies, declaring the turmoil an internal rebellion. This move effectively barred the IPC from intervening in \"Family affairs\" on both moral and rational grounds.\\n▶ **Welt:** Everyone really has their own agenda after all...\\n▶ **March 7th:** Then... what\\'s going to happen to Miss Robin? She and Sunday won\\'t be able to deny their involvement in the Charmony Festival, they\\'re siblings after all...\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** ...\\n▶ **March 7th:** Why the sigh, General?\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** I can only say that this incident is an unexpected mess for the girl. The Alliance will try to persuade The Family to consider this matter carefully during mediation.\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** It\\'s time, everyone. The IPC\\'s key members and I have agreed to consult one another before the upcoming negotiation. Do any of you wish to sit in?\\n▶ **Himeko:** Given the general\\'s invitation and the matter\\'s significance to the universe, the Crew will naturally accept. However, if the IPC has any reservations...\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** Why of course you\\'re welcome! They\\'ve mentioned that your team is a trusted ally of the IPC in Penacony, so there\\'s no reason not to welcome you.\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** Besides, if there can be reliable observers from the Astral Express present, discussions will go more smoothly. So, what do you all think?\\n▶ **Himeko:** Well then, we shall oblige.\\n▶ **March 7th:** ...I\\'m a kind of allergic to those types of situations. I think I\\'ll just head back to my room and start packing.\\n▶ **Welt:** Not to worry. Himeko and I will take care of things.\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** I\\'m afraid I\\'ll also have to return to the Express first. The conductor is worried about us. It\\'s best I go and explain the situation.\\n▶ ▶ **Himeko:** Thank you. What about you, (Trailblazer)? Will you join Welt and me, or have you got other plans?\\n I\\'ll go with Miss Himeko.\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** Haha, great.\\n I HAVE TO help March pack her suitcase...\\n▶ **March 7th:** What? I can pack it myself, you know...\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** Haha, if that\\'s the case, our Galactic Baseballer can join us.\\n Dunno why, but something tells me I only have one real option here...\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** Haha, good guess!\\n▶ ▶ **Jing Yuan:** Although I\\'m not too sure of the reason, the representatives from the IPC have insisted on (Trailblazer)\\'s presence — allow me to lead the way, follow me please!\\n\\n### Go to the Lobby and meet with the IPC representative\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Express Crew finally reunite victoriously. Accompanying you are Black Swan, the Memokeeper and Jing Yuan, the Luofu General.  \\nThe General and various IPC dignitaries have agreed to hold talks regarding the Charmony Festival incident — and they have invited the Express Crew to be present... You in particular, (Trailblazer). You have no reason to turn down this offer, right? Parlor Car\\n\\n(Upon dialogue completion)\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** The negotiation will commence at the hotel lobby. Everyone, please follow me.\\n\\n### Speak with the IPC and Intelligentsia Guild representatives\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n\\n(Approach quest location)\\n▶ **Himeko:** Mr. Aventurine and Miss Topaz are here too... And, who is that over there?\\n▶ **Welt:** The Intelligentsia Guild\\'s Dr. Ratio. This assembly is quite something.\\n(Talk to Aventurine, Dr. Ratio, or Topaz)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** It\\'s been a while, my Astral Express friends.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I would also extend my sincere thanks to you, General of the Luofu. The presence of everyone here assures that the talks will likely reach a conclusion that satisfies all sides.\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** Oh? Looks like everyone has come with expectations. Care to share?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Of course. Topaz, if you please?\\n▶ **Topaz:** Sure, leave it to me.\\n▶ **Topaz:** In summary, it\\'s good news — after much deliberation from the Strategic Investment Department\\'s council, the absolute majority of members have agreed to the following resolutions:\\n▶ **Topaz:** \"In light of long\\\\-term considerations for interastral peace, and by authority of Pier Point HQ, the Strategic Investment Department — on behalf of the Interastral Peace Corporation — will permanently relinquish its claim on Penacony sovereignty, and offer unconditional support of The Family\\'s rebuilding efforts on Penacony.\"\\n▶ **Himeko:** Uh...\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** Heh, now that\\'s something.\\n So, the IPC does see the big picture, huh?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** \"All in the name of peace\" — that\\'s our motto.\\n What\\'s in it for you guys?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** To be honest, it does nothing to benefit the IPC... but it is extremely beneficial to the long\\\\-term development of the entire universe.\\n Doesn\\'t that mean Aventurine took a hit for nothing?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Haha, if that\\'s what it takes to bring peace to the entire universe, it\\'s a price I\\'ll gladly pay.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Has the IPC finished sharing all its thoughts? Then it\\'s our turn.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** The Guild, much like the Genius Society, has taken a keen interest in the recent calamity in Penacony. Ultimately, both parties have agreed to a comprehensive collaboration, offering technical support for the reconstruction of Penacony...\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** ...The floor is yours for the finer points, Mr. Screwllum. Enlighten us, please.\\n▶ **Screwllum:** Organic life\\'s unrelenting search to understand the realm of inner spirituality is something I both admire and envy. Inorganic life has no mechanism to evoke dreams. But when my mechanical impulses are activated, my inspiration circuits will start to operate, and I will enter a state defined as \"imagination.\"\\n▶ **Screwllum:** Every time, within the realm of imagination, there emerges a fire from the shadows. It is warm, bright. I frequently ponder, this flame might represent the essence of intelligence — a cluster of inspiration ignited by high temperatures. The future direction of the universe may well lie within it.\\n▶ **Screwllum:** Alas, they are nothing but projections of my thought system to me — desired, but unattainable. But after learning of Penacony\\'s accomplishments, I have come to realize that the flame is not beyond my grasp.\\n▶ **Screwllum:** After deliberations with my partners, we have decided to defer the progress of the Simulated Universe project, and instead assist the Intelligentsia Guild as technological consultants in the research of the Dreamscape and Memory Zone, so that these assets may be better used to serve humanity.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Not only that, we\\'ve also established contact with the Garden of Recollection through the IPC, and they\\'ve pledged their support for our research endeavors...\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** I am truly happy for the Dreamchasers on Penacony — the cosmos\\'s brightest and, let\\'s admit, dimmer intellects are now at their service.\\n Hooray! It\\'s a big win for everyone!\\n▶ **Welt:** But... \\\\*sigh\\\\* Never mind. At the end of the day, this is a positive outcome.\\n I keep getting this feeling that this is all too good to be true...\\n▶ **Welt:** Agreed. It\\'s hard to imagine members of the Genius Society taking an interest in such mundane research...\\n▶ **Welt:** \\\\*sigh\\\\* Never mind. At the end of the day, this is a positive outcome.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ ▶ **Himeko:** No wonder everyone insisted that (he/she) be there.\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** It heartens me to learn that everyone is willing to put aside their differences for Penacony\\'s plight. I trust that everyone will surely reach consensus in the upcoming negotiations.\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** Looks like Penacony\\'s future is decided. I\\'m wondering, is there anything else the Crew is concerned about?\\n▶ **Himeko:** Peace is our greatest wish — beyond that, we desire nothing else.\\n▶ **Jing Yuan:** Haha, well that\\'s good. Now that everyone\\'s minds are at ease, I shall take my leave. You may now depart with peace of mind — the Alliance will deal with all subsequent procedures.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n**Some time later...**\\n▶ **Himeko:** If that\\'s the case, it appears that we have nothing else to worry about on Penacony... Looks like it\\'s time for us to embark on a new voyage.\\n▶ **Welt:** Sounds good to me.\\n▶ **Himeko:** You two head back to the Express first. I\\'ll pick up March and deal with the check\\\\-out procedure. Oh also, Miss Black Swan, you have a matter to discuss with me, yes?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Nothing escapes your attention, Miss Navigator.\\n▶ ▶ **Welt:** You\\'ve been with us this whole time, huh. In any case, (Trailblazer) and I will be waiting for you and March on the Express.\\n▶ ▶ **Welt:** Let\\'s go, (Trailblazer). Our time on Penacony... has come to a fruitful end.\\n\\n### Return to the Astral Express\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe IPC decides to develop Penacony alongside The Family, and scholars from all over the universe will assist in every way they can... It is a lively scene where all\\'s well that ends well. With this, your journey to Penacony, the \"Land of the Dreams\" has come to an end.  \\nIt\\'s time to embark on a new adventure. Parlor Car\\n\\n(Upon dialogue completion)\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (Penacony\\'s journey ends here...)\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (I guess it was pretty fruitful.)\\n(Talk to Topaz, optional)\\n▶ ▶ **Topaz:** This is all due to your heroic deeds in Penacony. Everyone\\'s been moved by your integrity and selflessness.\\n(Talk to Aventurine, optional)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Seems the dust has finally settled, no? Well done, friend.\\n(Talk to Dr. Ratio, optional)\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** I am truly happy for the Dreamchasers on Penacony — the cosmos\\'s brightest and, let\\'s admit, dimmer intellects are now at their service.\\n\\n### Join the navigation meeting\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n\\n(Teleport to Parlor Car)\\n(Obtain Achievement If We Walk in the Light)\\n▶ ▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** (Trailblazer), the navigation meeting is about to start. We\\'re all waiting for you!\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (When did the Express become so lively...?)\\n(Approach Black Swan, Boothill, and Pom\\\\-Pom)\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** Ahem... looks like everyone\\'s present. Let the navigation meeting commence then!\\n▶ **Boothill:** This a meeting to decide on our next stop? How we doin\\' this, by show of hands?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Hold your horses, cowboy. It\\'s for those to decide.\\n Boothill, why are you here?\\n▶ **Boothill:** Hah, I\\'m just catching a lift. Don\\'t sweat it!\\n Black Swan, how come you\\'re here too?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Shouldn\\'t this be expected of a Memokeeper?\\n What in tarnation are you guys doing here?\\n▶ **Himeko:** Allow me to explain: Mr. Boothill and Miss Black Swan submitted a request to temporarily travel with the Express for their own personal reasons...\\n▶ **Himeko:** As you all may also know, the Astral Express never declines any passenger whose heart yearns for the distant stars. Therefore, they will be traveling with us for a while, until they reach their destinations.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Whoa... The Express is going to be much livelier now. But Miss Black Swan, you\\'d better not use your Memokeeper abilities to pull any pranks!\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Understood, Miss March. I promise you, you\\'ll never see me in your room while you\\'re taking a break.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Uhm... Don\\'t, you\\'re freaking me out...\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** All right. All right. Now that everyone\\'s met everyone, we can continue our navigation meeting!\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** Firstly, Pom\\\\-Pom wishes to thank everyone. If it weren\\'t for you all unearthing the truth about Penacony, Pom\\\\-Pom would have never known where Mikhail and the rest had gone...\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** What they had to go through was regrettable, but I reckon they all fulfilled their wishes... And it was thanks to all of you — thank you, everyone.\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** Now then, we come to the crux of this navigation meeting: We must decide on the Express\\' next stop! Let me introduce our current options.\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** The first choice is from Himeko: The oceanic planet of Lushaka — a planet composed entirely of water. Many aquatic races reside there. Of course, it\\'s also the home planet of the venerable Nameless, Mikhail.\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** The second choice is the \"Agate World\" Melustanin, suggested by Welt. It\\'s famed as one of the initial sites of the Stellaron Disaster and the place where \"the Beauty\" Idrila ascended. Today, it\\'s celebrated as a planet of undying allure.\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** The third choice is Edo Star, a planet nestled within a vast ion storm region, currently under assault by the Antimatter Legion. However, the distress signals from there have recently ceased, prompting the IPC\\'s wish for us to check in on the situation.\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** The last choice, courtesy of Black Swan, is the \"Glass Belt\" Patrevia, a massive belt of asteroids that was turned to glass by the Lord Ravager Zephyro... These days it\\'s apparently known to house one of the branches of the Mourning Actors troupe.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Ooh... So many options. I\\'m seeing stars already.\\n▶ **Himeko:** Next up, everyone will select the destination that they wish to visit. And then, we\\'ll put it to a vote.\\n Oceanic planet of Lushaka.\\n▶ **Himeko:** Little Misha and Old Mikhail\\'s homeland... Having been through so much in Penacony, as an aspiring Nameless, I believe a visit to his home world is a must.\\n▶ **Welt:** Count me in. Still, I imagine that planet must have changed entirely after the Stellaron Disaster. I\\'ve heard that its landmasses no longer exist, and the native population has completely changed...\\n▶ **March 7th:** Hmm... I\\'m not against Miss Himeko\\'s choice, but Edo Star sounds like it\\'s in danger. As Nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** March is right. Though the fact that the distress signals have ceased means we\\'re probably too late... but I still think we should investigate the situation there.\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** Three votes for Lushaka, two for Edo...\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** Looks like we have a winner. Next stop: Lushaka, the ocean planet!\\n The Agate World, Melustanin.\\n▶ **Welt:** This trip to Penacony has allowed me to see another side of the Stellaron Disaster... In terms of symbolism, the state of the Dreamscape bears a striking resemblance to the Agate World. Visiting it might deepen our understanding of the Stellaron.\\n▶ **Himeko:** Mm... that makes sense. If that\\'s the case, I vote for the Agate World too.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Hmm... I personally think the situation on Edo Star might be more urgent. As Nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** March is right. Though the fact that the distress signals have ceased means we\\'re probably too late... but I still think we should investigate the situation there.\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** Three votes for the Agate World, two for Edo Star...\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** Looks like we have a winner. Next stop: The Agate World, Melustanin!\\n Edo Star.\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** Though the fact that the distress signals have ceased means we\\'re probably too late... but I still think we should investigate the situation there.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Yes, I agree! As Nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?\\n▶ ▶ **Welt:** (Trailblazer) and Dan Heng make good points. I\\'ll throw in a vote for Edo Star too.\\n▶ **Himeko:** If that\\'s the general sentiment, then we should indeed investigate. I vote for Edo Star too.\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** All votes for Edo Star...\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** Looks like we have a winner. Next stop: Edo Star!\\n The Glass Belt, Patrevia.\\n▶ **Himeko:** Black Swan has arranged to meet a Mourning Actor there. I\\'ve heard they\\'re preparing a special performance... I wouldn\\'t mind going to enjoy the show.\\n▶ **Welt:** That type of performance isn\\'t really my cup of tea, but... I\\'ll let you all decide.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Hmm... I\\'m really interested to check out this troupe\\'s performance, but it really sounds like the Edo Star is in a lot of trouble. As Nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** March is right. Though the fact that the distress signals have ceased means we\\'re probably too late... but I still think we should investigate the situation there.\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** Three votes for the Glass Belt, two for Edo Star...\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** Looks like we have a winner. Next stop: The Glass Belt, Patrevia!\\n I can\\'t make up my mind...\\n▶ **March 7th:** If that\\'s the case... How about we go to Edo Star first? If that planet really is in danger, then we should go help them out.\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** March is right. Though the fact that the distress signals have ceased means we\\'re probably too late... but I still think we should investigate the situation there.\\n▶ ▶ **Welt:** You and Dan Heng make good points. I\\'ll throw in a vote for Edo Star too.\\n▶ **Himeko:** If that\\'s the general sentiment, then we should indeed investigate. I vote for Edo Star too.\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** Four votes for Edo Star, one vote abstained...\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** Looks like we have a winner. Next stop: Edo Star!\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** Then this navigation meeting is adjourned. I\\'ll go check the warp jump coordinates. Everyone can catch up on some rest in the meantime.\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** When it\\'s time to make the jump, Pom\\\\-Pom will make an announcement!\\n\\n### Speak with Black Swan and wait for the warp jump to begin\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n\\n(Upon dialogue completion)\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (There\\'s still some time before the jump... What should I do?)\\n▶ ▶ **Black Swan:** (Trailblazer), how about a chat? Over here.\\n(Talk to March 7th, optional)\\n▶ **March 7th:** Please let this trip be uneventful. Please let this trip be uneventful. Please let this trip be uneventful...\\n Please let this trip be uneventful...\\n▶ **March 7th:** What\\'s with you and always copying the way I talk!\\n What are you mumbling about?\\n▶ **March 7th:** Mumbling!? I\\'m praying!\\n▶ **March 7th:** The last couple of trailblazing expeditions have been downright terrifying... It\\'s about time we had some fun, cozy, and cute adventures for a change!\\n▶ **March 7th:** Come on, start praying with me!\\xa0! \\\\[*sic*] Please let this trip be uneventful. Please let this trip be uneventful. Please let this trip be uneventful...\\n(Talk to Dan Heng, optional)\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** For some reason, I\\'m suddenly stricken by the feeling that... we haven\\'t crossed paths in quite some time.\\n It has indeed been a while.\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** Perhaps... the joy of reuniting after a long time can also be considered just another part of the Trailblaze.\\n This time, you must disembark with us when we reach our destination!\\n You\\'re always in my heart.\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** ...I should have known better than to expect anything serious from you.\\n This time, you must disembark with us when we reach our destination!\\n**Dan Heng:** Got it.\\n(Talk to Boothill, optional)\\n▶ **Boothill:** This Astral Express sure is comfy... but, I got one tiny problem with it. How come there ain\\'t no **potent** drinks on this ride?\\n▶ **Boothill:** I can live without malt juice, but at least stock somethin\\' else! Like that \"White Gem,\" common as dirt and not too pricey.\\n No way! Our express is only rated 12\\\\+!\\n▶ **Boothill:** You can\\'t use that 12\\\\-years\\\\-of\\\\-age rule against a mighty Ranger like me!\\n Is Himeko\\'s coffee not strong enough for you?\\n▶ **Boothill:** Uh, well... That\\'s a different kind of \"strong\"...\\n I\\'ll help you ask the conductor.\\n▶ ▶ **Boothill:** Thanks, (brother/sister)! Any low\\\\-cost swill will do, I ain\\'t fussy.\\n▶ **Boothill:** Ha, all these years out in the wild, and now I\\'m bunkin\\' in luxury... Gotta say, it\\'s quite the treat.\\n(Talk to Welt, optional)\\n▶ ▶ **Welt:** (Trailblazer), you\\'re fast becoming an excellent Trailblazer. It\\'s an honor to be able to watch you grow.\\n Hee\\\\-hee, stop flattering me.\\n▶ **Welt:** Don\\'t downplay your achievements, everyone has witnessed your growth. I\\'ve known many warriors in my time, and only a few achieve the kind of growth you have. Back home, where I\\'m from you\\'d be rated at least an S\\\\-tier.\\n Yup, I\\'m super\\\\-duper awesome!\\n▶ **Welt:** Yes, yes, you are. I\\'ve known many warriors in my time, and only a few achieve the kind of growth you have. Back home, where I\\'m from you\\'d be rated at least an S\\\\-tier.\\n▶ **Welt:** It\\'s not been easy for you these past few days. You\\'ve earned some downtime. I\\'m looking forward to seeing how you\\'ll perform on our next journey.\\n(Talk to Himeko, optional)\\n▶ ▶ **Himeko:** Come to think of it, (Trailblazer), this trip to Penacony was the first time we Trailblazed together, wasn\\'t it?\\n I hope we can Trailblaze together again someday.\\n▶ **Himeko:** Don\\'t worry. We\\'ll have plenty of time to spend together on the Express, so there\\'ll definitely be more chances for adventures like this.\\n It was too dangerous. I wish you hadn\\'t gone down.\\n▶ **Himeko:** It\\'s alright! I understand your concern, but it\\'s okay. I\\'m also a capable Nameless, just like yourself.\\n▶ **Himeko:** Turn in early today. You\\'ve really been pushing yourself hard recently. If you don\\'t take this chance to recharge, it could lead to long\\\\-term problems... It seems fine when you\\'re young, but it\\'s a different story as you age.\\n(Talk to Black Swan)\\n**Black Swan:** ...\\n▶ ▶ **Black Swan:** Oh? You\\'re here, (Trailblazer). Seeing your reflection among the stars in the porthole... really does seem somewhat surreal.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** How about it, this journey of beautiful dreams... Was it to your liking?\\n What a rollercoaster ride! It\\'s just... so peak... Keep it coming!\\n▶ **Black Swan:** I can feel your obvious excitement... That means your memories will also become even more beautiful.\\n It kind of left me wanting more, you know...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** That tinge of regret I sense... Ah, these are the kinds of lasting memories I cherish.\\n Seems like there are still lotsa loose ends, no?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** There\\'s a rich scent of curiosity here... Such memories can be irresistibly captivating.\\n It\\'s nothing short of a *deus ex machina*!\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Ah, such an intense emotion... Heh, makes you break out in a sweat, but you just can\\'t get enough.\\n When the next survey comes, I\\'ll be checking the \"Too Easy\" box... AGAIN.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Oh? Such elusive emotions... I\\'ve never encountered memories quite like this before, it\\'s stirred my curiosity.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** So... How about you hand that \"small parting gift\" back to me? I\\'m quite eager to have it back.\\n(Submit  Fate\\'s Epistle)\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Mm...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** ...Oh?\\n What happened?\\n It\\'s not this card?\\n I... I wasn\\'t the one who broke it...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Hmm, never mind...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** I just... stumbled upon a particularly fascinating spot in your memory.\\n▶ ▶ **Black Swan:** Before I explain... I would like to apologize to you, (Trailblazer): This farewell gift I gave you isn\\'t really a compass from the Memory Zone... but a merely an empty Light Cone.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Remember when we entered the hotel in the Dreamscape for the first time, and I procured a few trinkets from your companions? Their functions are similar.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** This way, I can always be attuned to your location, ready to assist immediately if you encounter any threats.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** But... this is not its most intrinsic function.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Light Cones are slices of light used to encapsulate solidified phenomenaRemembrance. This empty Light Cone is the same.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** It can etch your memories in their most vivid form, and then... allow me to admire and manipulate them, turning them into unique mementos.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** All the world is born from the power of mind and soul, and that power is \"memory.\" To prevent ourselves from being forgotten by the world, we must make the world remember us... or, use our memories to recreate it.\\n▶ ▶ **Black Swan:** Life, seemingly vast, offers but a scant collection of impactful memories: Some joyful, some sorrowful, some light, some heavy... But you, (Trailblazer), are different.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Memory is a reflection of the future. Within that reflection, I see your unparalleled worth. You have the power to craft memories that can captivate the world... Your memory can illuminate the universe\\'s future path.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** And that memory... will be as scintillating as the star clusters you see in this porthole.\\n Which is why you want to collect my memories?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Precisely. But, do you know the deeper meaning behind it?\\n You\\'re making me blush...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** How adorable. But, do you know the deeper meaning behind it?\\n Help me take a look, am I about to ascend?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** The memories I have of you are not enough for me to predict a future that lies too far ahead.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** But, I can tell you one thing: My favor towards you stems from a more profound reason.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** The reason is simple: In this grandiose and ostentatious dream of The Family\\'s, only you personally experienced the entire course.\\n What does that mean?\\n Stop speaking in riddles!\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Patience, my friend. I will reveal the answer to you... but that time is not now.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Turn around and take a look at your friends. Every one of them is reveling at the arrival of their next destination, all filled with hopes and expectations of their own present and future. Revealing everything at this moment would be a bit of a buzzkill, wouldn\\'t it?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** I\\'m looking for an opportune time, a time when you\\'re totally at ease... Perhaps, when the night grows hazy, and you\\'re about to drift off would be the most opportune.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** How about one fine night? I will prepare the candles, aromatics, and even a cushy couch to create a cozy dream land for you. And then, I will tell you the answer in the form of a little bedtime story to lull you to sleep...\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** Ahem, hi, hello\\\\~ Attention all passengers.\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** The Express is about to make the jump — please be seated and hold on!\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Heh, it looks like we\\'re finally about to set off. There are countless gleaming memories out there waiting for us... Why don\\'t we just leave it at that for now?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Ah, that\\'s right. As a small token of compensation for playing that little trick on you with the empty Light Cone, I will gift you with some words — they hold great significance to me...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** \"Life is akin to a winding labyrinth, where memories serve as our sole companions.\"\\n▶ **Black Swan:** You\\'ll remember these words dearly, won\\'t you?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n**▶ In the year 2158 of the Amber Era, the first year of the new epoch, the universe resumed its intended trajectory. The kindling of conspiracy smoldered in Penacony, the Land of the Dreams.

There were no survivors.  \\nHowever, there is still a chance to turn this around. The Memokeeper points out that there is a fatal flaw in the story that you experienced. Behind this fatal flaw lies a glimmer of hope.  \\nNow, you have seen through the illusion of Ena\\'s Dream... However, if you wish to awaken everyone in Asdana, you will need far more people on your side... The Reverie (Dreamscape)\\n\\nMedia:Trailblaze Mission The Sun Also Rises.mp4   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n▶ **Black Swan:** Well, let\\'s start with the conclusion — The Crew was defeated in the battle against Sunday. Everyone in Penacony failed, and no one survived.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** But don\\'t panic. The truth, as horrifying as it may be, is not yet irreversible. There\\'s still a glimmer of hope, and that\\'s why I\\'m here.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Next, I\\'ll use this empty light cone that carries all your memories to relive everything that happened before. And when this story reaches its end, I\\'m sure someone as clever as you will notice that...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** There\\'s a major flaw in the story you have experienced, yet within that flaw lies a glimmer of hope.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Are you ready for it?\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n \\n▶ **Black Swan:** Do you remember everything? When the clock turned back, the Express started a warp jump, sending you to a strange dream. You were bewildered back then, and then a Galaxy Ranger named Acheron showed you a way out.\\n\\n▶ **Black Swan:** When you arrived at The Reverie Hotel, you met the doormanbellboy Misha and had a confrontation with Aventurine, an IPC representative. Thankfully, Acheron appeared again and helped you.\\n \\n▶ **Black Swan:** After that, you saved Firefly and explored Penacony together. During the tour, you ran into Sparkle disguised as Sampo and accidentally entered a child\\'s dream.\\n \\n▶ **Black Swan:** There, I rescued both of you from \"Death,\" but Firefly didn\\'t return to reality. She realized the truth and tried to involve you in her plan, but that resulted in an accidental \"death.\" Even more unsettling, you soon encountered another \"murder.\"\\n\\n▶ **Black Swan:** The two cases of \"death\" prompted you to investigate the truth behind the sweet dream. Despite your efforts to gather information about the two victims, you didn\\'t make much progress. But you did learn about the Watchmaker from Gallagher.\\n\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Meanwhile, Aventurine was secretly carrying out his scheme, in which you were one of the pawns. In the midst of a fierce battle, Acheron revealed her true identity as an Emanator of the Nihility and unsheathed her sword.\\n\\n▶ **Black Swan:** That strike foiled Aventurine\\'s plan and opened a passage between the sweet dream and the original Memory Zone. Upon your arrival at Dreamflux Reef, you learned the truth that \"Death\" was actually \"Dormancy\", as well as the truth about the Dreamscape, the Stellaron, and the bellboy, Misha.\\n \\n▶ **Black Swan:** You split up with Sunday and Robin, looking for a way to seal the Stellaron. However, it turned out that Sunday and the Dreammaster had their own hidden agenda, and you had to engage in an ultimate duel on the stage of the Charmony Festival.\\n\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Finally, the story reached its conclusion. You emerged victorious, with the Trailblaze triumphing over the Order and Penacony embracing a bright and peaceful future...\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nMedia:Trailblaze Mission The Sun Also Rises.mp4   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n▶ **Black Swan:** This marks the end of the thrilling journey in Penacony. I\\'m sure you\\'ve already noticed something unusual, haven\\'t you?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** The major flaw, which contradicts all the known information, hides in this story...\\n My first encounter with Misha at the hotel...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Heh, little Misha... or should I call him the Watchmaker?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** He is only a segment of memory in a dream bubble, but his ambition for the Trailblaze led him to leave the bubble and embark on a grand adventure in Penacony...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** While Misha is a rather special Memory Zone Meme, and he was granted power by the Trailblaze... there\\'s still one thing that he shouldn\\'t be able to do—\\n▶ **Black Swan:** ...A life born in the Memory Zone could never manifest in reality. So, why did he appear in The Reverie Hotel in reality?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** The answer is simple — He is the one fatal flaw that contradicts all our known information. This means that you, who wholeheartedly believe in this memory...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Are still trapped in the Dreamscape at this very moment.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Wake up, (Trailblazer). Break free from this eternal dream and return to the real world. We\\'ll find our answersa glimmer of hope there.\\n(Continue below)\\n I was attacked by Sparkle disguised as Sampo...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Sparkle — yes, Sparkle, the most enigmatic and elusive character in the entire story. But unfortunately, she was the first to uncover the truth, and she did purposefully attack you to create confusion.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** By the way, she left me a message to pass on to you. \"Always make sure you can distinguish reality from imagination.\"\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Is that a clue, you may wonder? I\\'m not sure, although I\\'m pretty sure that the fatal flaw has nothing to do with that Masked Fool.\\n(Go back to dialogue choice with the option removed)\\n The fake deaths of Firefly and Robin...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Well, although the fake \"deaths\" of those two ladies don\\'t align with our initial assumptions, this fact itself doesn\\'t contradict the information we have so far.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** I\\'ll go ahead and eliminate that incorrect answer for you. So, what is the fatal flaw?\\n(Go back to dialogue choice with the option removed)\\n Acheron unsheathed her sword and revealed the power of the Nihility...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Are you suggesting that the sleeping and shapelessIX, the Nihility never bestows its gaze upon anyone, and thus no one can truly possess the power of the Nihility?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** That\\'s a very astute guess, but unfortunately, Acheron did progress further down the Path of the Nihility. Her unwavering belief in liberating the world from the grasp of Paths surpasses the capabilities of ordinary humans.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** I\\'ll discard that incorrect answer for you. Take your time and think it through — What is the fatal flaw?\\n(Go back to dialogue choice with the option removed)\\n \"Death\" is the disguise of \"Dormancy\"...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** It\\'s true that Gallagher is a History Fictionologist, but he didn\\'t lie in this matter. In addition, \"death\" and \"dormancy\" do arise from the same concept, don\\'t they?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** This is not the fatal flaw in your adventure. Take your time and think it through.\\n(Go back to dialogue choice with the option removed)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Cutscene plays)\\n\\n**Pom\\\\-Pom:** The train is about to make the jump!\\n**Pom\\\\-Pom:** 5\\n**Pom\\\\-Pom:** 4\\n**Pom\\\\-Pom:** 3\\n**Pom\\\\-Pom:** 2\\n(Cutscene ends)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Teleports to The Reverie (Dreamscape))\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (Back in this familiar room...)\\n▶ **Black Swan:** This way, darling.\\n(Talk to Black Swan, optional)\\n▶ **Black Swan:** What\\'s wrong? Are you not feeling well?\\n I feel fine.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** That\\'s good then.\\n I don\\'t feel so good...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** I know you\\'re more sensitive to memoria, thus more easily affected by the Dreamscape than others. This is also why I have to accompany you.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** I shall use my methods to relieve you. Don\\'t worry, as your companions are safe — I had both of them each give me a trinket before I entered the dream. This will allow me to feel their presence in the Memory Zone.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** They\\'re already awake in their rooms. Will you be comfortable in following me now? Time waits for no one. We must hurry to the lobby.\\n(Approach the designated location)\\n▶ **Acheron:** Not another one...\\n▶ **Acheron:** Thank you so much, Black Swan.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Finally, I can breathe a sigh of relief.\\n What happened?\\n What is this place?\\n The deja vu is strong with this scene...\\n▶ **Acheron:** I understand you must be confused, and we\\'ll do our best to shed light on the situation. However, before that, it\\'s essential to know that...\\n▶ **Acheron:** This place is the rift between dream and reality. A place reserved only for those who have awakened from Ena\\'s dream.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Do you remember Sunday\\'s ambitious plan? He intended to harness the power of the Stellaron, the collective will of over 100,000 Oak Family members, and the desires of everyone in Penacony to usurp the Harmony and restore the Order.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Unfortunately, it didn\\'t stop there. From the early days of our journey into Asdana, we were already affected by the Stellaron. That strange Dreamscape where we met... Maybe it was a sign that your thoughts were beginning to drift away.\\n All of this is just a dream?\\n Did I fall asleep on the Express?\\n I\\'m now back at the beginning of the story?\\n▶ **Acheron:** I don\\'t think... the goal of the Order was to put everyone into a deep sleep. Quite the contrary — they used the Stellaron to catalyze the leakage of Asdana\\'s memoria into the material world, allowing the Dreamscape to blend with reality.\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...And that included a lot of memoria from the Beyond the Sky Choir. As time came and went, the dreams eventually became indistinguishable from reality, and reality became an illusion. People think they are awake, but their spirits have long since stepped into the temple of Order.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** This is what makes Ena\\'s Dream so powerful. In this paradise governed by the Order, everyone indulges in their delightful dreams and lives happily ever after.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** I believe what you experienced in the sweet dream, except for that flaw, was real. Only in this way could you reach the destination, lifting the crisis in Penacony and embarking on your next trailblazing expedition.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** If it wasn\\'t for Acheron\\'s plan, we might have been trapped in this dream forever.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Fortunately, while the Path of the Order governs all things, it can\\'t affect the Nihility. I came to realize this when the Dreammaster tried to expel me at any cost.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** This is also why you felt a sense of peculiarity when traveling with her.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Well, I\\'m not as fortunate as she is. Even if I\\'m a Memokeeper, I was still influenced by the power of the Order and fell into hallucinations.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** However, thanks to your memories, now we still have a chance to turn the tide.\\n▶ **Acheron:** For mortals, even if they possess the great power of a Path, they can\\'t create a flawless world like Gods do.\\n▶ **Acheron:** That\\'s why there was a flaw in your dream. In other words, once you have realized the world is not real, you\\'ll have a chance to break free from the dream.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** The flaw in your dream lies within Misha, who could have never appeared in reality. When I turned the pages of your memories, I realized that I was in an illusion, too.\\n We still have a fighting chance.\\n So, we lost...\\n Didn\\'t expect it all comes back to Misha...\\n▶ **Acheron:** Now Sunday has usurped the power of the Harmonious ChoirShared Wish\\'s Harmonious Embodiment through the Charmony Festival. Asdana has thus fallen into Ena\\'s Dream, transforming everyone equally into the notespuppets of the Aeon.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Failure doesn\\'t mean weakness. Only the strong can gather the will to resist the Order and try to break free.\\n▶ **Acheron:** We still have a chance, though. To make it happen... please, Black Swan, guide us to those with a strong will.\\n\\n### Go to the Lobby and meet with everyone\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Alright, please come with me.\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** These people are...?\\n▶ **Acheron:** They\\'re the ones who accept Ena\\'s Dream and indulge in their happy illusions...\\n▶ **Acheron:** We have no means to wake them up now. Not even your clockwork will do the trick.\\n▶ **Acheron:** However, there are still other things we can do. Let\\'s keep going.\\n(Talk to One Lost in a Dream, optional)\\n\\n(One of the following will be displayed at random)\\nSingle\\\\-minded, this person dives into the dreamscape, having not the slightest reaction to your arrival.\\nTheir eyes are dulled but their lips curl up at the edges, as though transfixed in overwhelming joy.\\nTheir eyes simply droop as they giggle like a fool at only god knows what.\\nThe spark has completely gone from their eyes, replaced by a colossal mania.\\nThey are so immersed in the maniacal fantasy that they completely fail to notice your very existence.\\n Activate Clockwork\\n Leave.\\n(Try to tune One Lost in a Dream from  **Satisfied**)\\n\"Welcome to the Paradise!\"\\n(After trying to tune One Lost in a Dream)\\n\\n(One of the following will be displayed at random)\\nYour \"clockwork\" doesn\\'t seem to be working anymore.\\nYour \"clockwork\" is unable to point this person in the right direction.\\nYour \"clockwork\" has no sway on them whatsoever.\\nYour \"clockwork\" is completely ineffectual.\\nLooks like there\\'s no way to rouse this person from their slumber for now — not even with your \"clockwork.\"\\n(Floating words)\\nThis is the promised land for us!\\nIt is done!

Robin?)\\n(Talk to Robin)\\n▶ **Robin:** Finally, you\\'ve arrived.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Let me introduce you to Robin. She woke up from Ena\\'s Dream by her own will, and it\\'s this tough lady who led us here with her song.\\n▶ **Robin:** I woke up for the same reason as all of you. In the dream, I experienced something that could never occur in reality...\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nMedia:Trailblaze Mission Small Town Grotesque 2\\\\.mp4   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n▶ **Robin:** Are we going to lock it up in a cage? I want to see it fly freely in the sky.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Without us, this bird would be too fragile to survive on its own. Do you want it to die?\\n▶ **Robin:** No, but...\\n▶ **Sunday:** ...\\n▶ **Sunday:** Then let\\'s take care of it together until it can return to the sky.\\n▶ **Robin:** ...Huh?\\n▶ **Sunday:** Birds have wings because they\\'re meant to fly. Even if they may crash on the ground one day, they shouldn\\'t be trapped in a cage.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Birds belong to the sky, so we should help them return there, right?\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Robin:** ...The illusion was so impossibly blissful that I realized it was just a dream.\\n▶ **Robin:** And this is our final hope. Ena\\'s Dream is founded upon the Harmonious Choir, namely everyone\\'s shared wishes. It will only materialize once the aspirations of all beings in Penacony merge as one.\\n▶ **Robin:** At present, it has become impervious due to people\\'s desire to remain slumbering within the dream. And in order to destroy it...\\n▶ **Robin:** We must make everyone in Penacony want to wake up.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Now comes the tricky part. How do we do it?\\n I\\'m curious, too.\\n That doesn\\'t sound simple at all...\\n Maybe we should just go back to Ena\\'s Dream?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** You want to go back? Unfortunately, human consciousness always gravitates toward reality. Now that you\\'ve seen the flaw in the dream, there is no turning back.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Humans\\' yearning for sweet illusions borders on obsession, leading them to subconsciously resist... the harsh reality.\\n▶ ▶ **Black Swan:** Therefore, I carefully selected a moment where (Trailblazer) was completely unguarded, guiding (him/her) to uncover the truth (himself/herself) to make (him/her) regain (his/her) consciousness.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** However, to wake up everyone in Penacony and get them to share the same determination... that would be nearly impossible.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Indeed. I\\'m afraid it\\'s almost as difficult as resurrecting an Aeon...\\n(Boothill and Dan Heng walk towards the group)\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** But we can\\'t just stay here and do nothing.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Boothill:** This is a critical moment for the whole universe! Who cares about some dumb number?\\n You\\'ve woken up, too?\\n Well, well, well, someone enjoys making a dramatic entrance.\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** Thanks to Black Swan.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** You\\'re welcome. And thanks to the Memokeepers in Penacony, too. I believe your partners... have also awakened from their dreams.\\n▶ **Acheron:** This is the first step of our plan. With the assistance from the Garden of Recollection, those who possess a strong will, like you, will gradually awaken from the dream. These free wills are the \"discord\" that will sway Ena\\'s Dream.\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** However, awakening a mere handful of individuals is insignificant compared to the vast number of people immersed in the dream. We must find other ways to awaken the free will of millions of people within a short period of time.\\n▶ **Acheron:** If breaking through from the inside proves challenging, we can seek assistance from the outside. We\\'ve long been aware of a potential solution.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Asdana is a galaxy known for its abundant memoria and the remarkable phenomenon known as Synesthesia Dreamscape. When people first enter this place, they often find themselves and others sharing a collective dream...\\n▶ **Acheron:** At this very moment, there is only one dream encompassing the entire Asdana system.\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** So you mean, if we can attract a large number of outsiders to this system, their free will would intertwine with this dream and shake it to its core...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** However, those outsiders might also succumb to the dream and become the foundation of the Order instead. The real challenge is — How can we gather a huge number of people as determined as you within a short period of time?\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** ...\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** Looks like the Jade Abacus of Allying Oath will be the only solution.\\n▶ **Boothill:** ...No, no need for that.\\n▶ **Boothill:** Keep your once\\\\-in\\\\-a\\\\-lifetime treasure. We don\\'t need to bother the Xianzhou Alliance for such a tiny request. You want thousands of people with unwavering free will? Hah, that\\'s easy...\\n▶ **Boothill:** Just leave it to us Galaxy Rangers.\\n▶ **Dan Heng:** You can gather Galaxy Rangers?\\n▶ **Boothill:** Hah! Outsiders may see Galaxy Rangers as elusive and disconnected individuals, and actually... they\\'re right! And that\\'s why we have a tacit understanding among us...\\n\\n▶ **Boothill:** Do you know what it is, Acheron?\\n▶ **Acheron:** It\\'s the relic I returned to you.\\n▶ **Boothill:** Exactly. Its owner must have told you that it\\'s meaningless to anyone other than a Galaxy Ranger, and that it can only fulfill its purpose when returned to its rightful owner.\\n▶ **Boothill:** Because it\\'s a burial artifact, worthy only of a hero who has served the Galaxy Rangers with honor. When its light illuminates the universe, it means the fall of a hero, and in the direction it falls...\\n▶ **Boothill:** Countless meteors will streak across the sky. Those \"meteors\" are Galaxy Rangers coming from all corners of the Cosmos, driven by a shared purpose, without questioning the cause or counting the cost. Because we abide by a bottom line...\\n▶ **Boothill:** The shooting stars of The Hunt only descend on the longest night, and with them... comes the dawn.\\n▶ **Boothill:** We\\'ve stayed silent for far too long. Now, it\\'s time to remind all the cowards, oppressors, and villains of the universe of our presence! I\\'ll be the one to ignite the first spark.\\n▶ **Robin:** Once the Dreamscape is swayed, I\\'ll complete the second step. I\\'ll fine\\\\-tune the slumbering souls with the song of the Harmony, interrupting them with the discord of \"Trailblaze\" and guiding them towards reality.\\n▶ **Robin:** It\\'s true that some people are born strong, and others are born weak. If the Trailblaze is the target of heroes, then the Harmony will guarantee that the strong help the weak. Only the people of Penacony themselves can be the saviors of their homeland.\\n▶ **Robin:** Their path of happiness should be forged by themselves.

Ena\\'s Dream... is too cruel for him, and everyone else.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Your plan sounds well\\\\-conceived, but still, it appears somewhat... idealistic and romantic. The flaws rooted in human nature can\\'t be eradicated overnight. Do you believe these efforts alone are enough to convince everyone to choose the right path?\\n▶ **Acheron:** I agree with you, Black Swan. That\\'s why the most critical aspect of this plan is not to convince everyone to choose the right path...\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...But to inspire them to save themselves.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Black Swan:** So, you\\'re the key in the end, I assume?\\n▶ **Acheron:** The Harmonious Choir possesses the power of an Emanator. To overcome it, you\\'ll need the same level of power. The final step in destroying the sweet dream... will be my responsibility.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** That\\'s a relief to hear.\\n▶ **Boothill:** Now that our roles are assigned, let\\'s get to our battlefields and pose a grand finale!\\n▶ ▶ **Acheron:** May I have a moment alone with you, (Trailblazer)? There\\'s one more thing I need to explain to you.\\n▶ **Acheron:** This grand festival is drawing to its close. This is the starting point for the ultimate stage of our journey... just as it marked the beginning of all the stories in Penacony.\\n Whatever we\\'re facing, I\\'m prepared.\\n▶ **Acheron:** I have faith in you. However, before we depart, there is one more thing I must tell you.\\n This is where Firefly uncovered the truth.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Indeed, she was the first to discover the world beyond the shores of \"death\" and shared this truth with all of us.\\n Your words still carry... a profound significance.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Only by reflecting on our steps can we remember the path we should be walking on... and the companions who have walked alongside us.\\n▶ **Acheron:** There\\'s something you should know. We were able to locate you within this boundless dream and find the key to breaking free from the dream, all because of one person\\'s unwavering dedication...\\n▶ **Acheron:** Firefly. She awakened from the dream ahead of others, discovered the Express amidst the stars, and brought us valuable information about the remnants of the Order. She may have been aided by the script, and it came at a cost...\\n▶ **Acheron:** As you know, Firefly is a stowaway who entered the Dreamscape in a different way from ours. Without the dreampool in the hotel or assistance from The Family, she can only awaken from this dream in one way... a real \"death.\"\\n▶ **Acheron:** We mustn\\'t fail her determination. I\\'m not implying that we must win this fight no matter what, but our resolve should match that of the courageous lady.\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...Are you ready?\\n Let\\'s embark on the final stage.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Very well. Now, please close your eyes...\\n(Proceed to And on the Eighth Day (Domain of Excursion))\\n I\\'m not quite ready yet...\\n▶ **Acheron:** That\\'s alright. Take your time to contemplate this moment.

They were heroes in their time, and they won\\'t be reduced to puppets of the Nihility in their death.\\n▶ **Acheron:** You see, the shadows on the sea have vanished. Do you remember? You once said that the sky would clear when the regrets of the departed had faded away.\\n▶ **???:** But it\\'s still raining...\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...I know.\\n▶ **???:** So, why is all this...?\\n▶ **???:** Why did this rain choose me?\\n▶ **Acheron:** Because someone\\'s regrets haven\\'t been fulfilled, perhaps.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Mortals who walk the Paths are like sailors on a vast ocean, leaving behind a trail that creates countless ripples of possibilities. These ripples last longer than the fleeting lifetimes of humans.\\n▶ **Acheron:** And for some, their presence leaves such a strong mark that it\\'s reflected in the waves.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Sin Thirsters... the obsessions of the Pathstriders.

Only then will I be able to put an end to the final regret by the Dead Sea.\\n▶ **???:** Will I... ever see them again?\\n▶ **Acheron:** Yes — that is certain.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Because it was you who told me about the Express, your two former companions, the expedition cut short by the Swarm, your narrow escape from death, and your encounter with the Galaxy Rangers...\\n▶ **Acheron:** And Penacony, the hometown to which you could never return.\\n▶ **???:** Yeah, for countless times...

But, when you make your decision...  \\n...It will appear once again.  \\nAnd you, you must carefully ruminate on its meaning, then return to the waking world.  \\nWe will find our answer there. Horizon of Existence\\n\\n▶ **Acheron:** Welcome to Horizon of Existence...\\n▶ **Acheron:** This place is one of the thousands of manifestations belonging to the sleeping and shapelessIX, the Nihility, and it\\'s also an exit out of the Nihility for the awake ones.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Let\\'s bid our final farewells here.\\n(While walking)\\n▶ **Sparkle:** Always distinguish between reality and imagination... alright, Gray?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** \"Life is akin to a winding labyrinth, where memories serve as our sole companions.\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** May your schemes... be forever concealed.\\n▶ **Robin:** Ena\\'s Dream... is too cruel for him, and everyone else.\\n▶ **Gallagher:** To the imperfect tomorrow.\\n▶ **Firefly:** I still remember the question on the invitation letter — Why does life slumber?\\n\\n(Approach Acheron)\\n▶ **Acheron:** Why does life slumber...?

So, when will people actively save themselves?\\n▶ **Acheron:** The answer is... when they are in desperate situations.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Like a drowning individual in the deep sea, when one\\'s body and mind bear immense pressure, agony, confusion, and despair will follow. I firmly believe that...\\n▶ **Acheron:** The fragility of humankind often freezes them in their tracks, but in truly desperate situations they will strive to save themselves. And now... Penacony has enough heroes to lead them forward.\\n▶ **Acheron:** It\\'s through this inherent self\\\\-centered instinct that people exert their utmost effort, even when they know their struggle is fruitless. As absurd as it may seem, it\\'s their resistance.\\n▶ ▶ **Acheron:** As for now, (Trailblazer)... It is time to guide them, not as a savior, but as a Nameless among those mortals.\\n▶ **Acheron:** In this way, you will reunite in the warmth of the sunlight.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Acheron:** The rain... is intensifying.

If you had grasped the journey\\'s finale right from its inception...\\n▶ **Acheron:** I would ask — Would you still embark on this journey?\\n I would blaze a trail without hesitation.\\n▶ **Acheron:** I\\'m glad. The answer itself doesn\\'t matter. What matters is that you\\'ve made a decision.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Listen, touch, and ponder, and therein lies the sensation. Cherish it, because that\\'s what makes us exist. Such is the only answer humans can offer when facing the Nihility.\\n▶ **Acheron:** If the Nihility represents the primal fear of life, rendering any lofty convictions insignificant under THEIR imposing shadow...\\n▶ **Acheron:** Then behind this shadow, there must exist the most fervent source of light in the world.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Just as every life that edges closer to death fervently approaches the end of the Nihility...\\n▶ **Acheron:** We must pursue that primordial light.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nMedia:Trailblaze Mission And on the Eighth Day 3\\\\.mp4   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n▶ **\"Tiernan\":** Now come to think that you exist in the Nihility, and you watch over others to depart it...\\n▶ **\"Tiernan\":** Such a task is absurd and meaningless.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Nevertheless, someone has to do it.

In the blink of an eye, you transition from the comfortable couch of the Parlor Car to an unfamiliar location. A stranger awakens you, claiming that both of you coincidentally share the same dream, and offers to guide you to an exit.  \\nFollow her guidance and leave this area. A Strange Dream\\n\\n▶ **???:** Not another one...\\n▶ **???:** ...Come with me.\\n Who are you?\\n What is this place?\\n Where are we going?\\n▶ **???:** These questions... have no meaning. But, I will answer you as best as I can: This is the border between reality and the Memory Zone, a... dreamscape.\\n▶ **???:** Right this moment, you and I have coincidentally shared the same dreamscape, and appeared in each other\\'s minds. This is the Land of Dreams\\'s inaugural welcome for us.\\n▶ **???:** Worry not, for very quickly, you will awaken from this dream, forget everything that has transpired, with naught but a faint lingering of loss.\\n▶ **???:** Pay no mind, for this forgetfulness happens with each new dawn. It is an occurrence that we have become accustomed to for so long.\\n▶ **???:** ...So, come with me. I\\'ll take you home.\\n\\n### Continue down the unfamiliar corridor\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe warrior calls herself \"Acheron,\" a Galaxy Ranger.  \\nContinue to follow in her footsteps and leave this strange dream.

May you experience an unforgettable holiday! If you need help checking in, please head straight to the concierge...\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Acheron:** Leave this realm, and rise as you would on any other day. Forget this fortuitous encounter, and return whence you came.\\n▶ **Acheron:** But before you do, I would make a request of you.\\n▶ **Acheron:** You may think it somewhat strange, perhaps even rude, but I wish to know...\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...Have we met somewhere before?\\n Perhaps we have.\\n Probably not.\\n I don\\'t know.\\n What do you mean?\\n What\\'s going on...\\n▶ ▶ **Acheron:** You evoke memories of an old friend. In the haze of my recollections, (he crossed blades/she stood shoulder to shoulder) with me,\\\\[Note 3]much like this surreal dreamscape where we stood close, yet forever out of reach.\\n▶ **Acheron:** May I ask you a few more questions? I... tend to forget things — which is why, rather than memories, I\\'m accustomed to using my emotions to capture what I normally wouldn\\'t otherwise. The answer is inconsequential. Your spontaneous reaction is what matters.\\n▶ **Acheron:** For instance, when you awaken in your room, your lips speak several names. Are they your companions? Family? Enemies? You seem to have forged unbreakable bonds with many people and many incidents...\\n▶ **Acheron:** Might I ask if you fear losing these bonds?\\n I cannot bear such a fear.\\n If it means losing them, I would.\\n If it means that I will disappear, I would.\\n I feel no fear.\\n I don\\'t know.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Mm... Then, if there was a vast dreamscape, so lifelike it\\'s indistinguishable from reality. There, no one faces life\\'s separations or deaths. Everyone attains their deserved happiness and lives joyfully ever after.\\n▶ **Acheron:** I would ask: Would you wish to stay?\\n I would, no matter the cost.\\n If I didn\\'t have to pay any price, I would.\\n That depends on the price I\\'d have to pay.\\n I would never want to live in a dream.\\n I don\\'t know.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Now... imagine if this splendid dream were fated to fall apart: Friends, family, strangers, followed by the gentle breeze, soaring birds, the stars... and ultimately, yourself.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Everyone, and every face they remember, the joy and the heartaches, the vows sealed and those left hanging... all will inevitably march towards a predetermined ending. If you had grasped the journey\\'s finale right from its inception...\\n▶ **Acheron:** I would ask: Would you still embark on this journey?\\n I would abandon it — the price is too dear.\\n I would abandon it — I have already tasted the beauty of dreams.\\n I would abandon it — Trailblazing was never my intent.\\n I would blaze a trail without hesitation.\\n I don\\'t know.\\n▶ **Acheron:** I know this is hard, you don\\'t have to be hard\\\\-pressed to make a decision. As I have said... the answer is inconsequential.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Hearing, touch, thought — through these, you gain emotions — cherish them. With emotions, we make choices. And so we return to the original question...\\n▶ **Acheron:** I would ask... Do you still remember me?\\n I seem to remember you from somewhere...\\n No, this is the first time we\\'ve met.\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...I understand.\\n▶ **Acheron:** How interesting. For a split second, it felt like countless versions of you, alike yet distinct, gave entirely different responses.\\n▶ **Acheron:** That was my final question, thank you. We all have our paths to walk, so we shall bid our farewells.\\n Will we meet again?\\n You haven\\'t told me how to leave this place...\\n▶ **Acheron:** The golden dream is getting restless. In the coming long night, I\\'m afraid you will face many tribulations and witness many tragedies. And finally... your sight will only see black and white.\\n▶ **Acheron:** But please believe me that in that monochrome world, there will be a glimpse of fleeting red, and when you make a choice, it will reappear before you once more...\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Cutscene plays)\\n\\n**Acheron:** What you must do now is ponder its significance.\\n**Acheron:** And then...\\n**Acheron:** You can return to the waking world.\\n**Acheron:** That\\'s where we all find our answers.\\n(Cutscene ends)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** (Trailblazer), what\\'s wrong? Wh—Why are you crying all of a sudden?\\n I may have dreamed of a tragic future...\\n I may have dreamed of an old friend...\\n I dreamed of a riddler spouting strange talk...\\n I dreamed I was slashed by someone with a blade...\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** ...S—Sounds like you had a nightmare! We just arrived in Asdana and already... You should be careful, it seems your tolerance to memoria isn\\'t the strongest.\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** Don\\'t fret, dreams are often the reverse of reality. While you were sleeping, the Express arrived at Penacony...\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** ...Can you imagine? Yesterday\\'s grim frontier prison is today\\'s lavish hotel. I wish I could wander Penacony\\'s streets today, but I\\'m pretty train\\\\-tied at the moment. You\\'ll have to be my eyes and ears while we\\'re here.\\n▶ **Pom\\\\-Pom:** ...Gear up and make sure you\\'ve got everything!

And with The Family\\'s invite, all guests from all over the cosmos have thronged this place...\\n▶ **???:** Hotel security is on high alert, with zero room for error. And with such a last minute change, it really isn\\'t something that this young lady\\'s words can resolve on a whim. My esteemed guests from the Astral Express, please do not make it harder for her.\\n▶ **Welt:** We\\'re sorry for all the trouble our check\\\\-in seems to have caused. Might I ask for your name?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I am the humble Aventurine of the IPC\\'s Strategic Investment Department, a Non\\\\-Performing Asset Liquidation Specialist and subordinate to supervisor Diamond. I was cordially invited by the Watchmaker...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I also happen to be a traveler that\\'s had to stand behind you for quite a while.\\n▶ **Himeko:** ...Leave it to me.\\n▶ **Himeko:** I\\'ve heard that the IPC has also received Penacony\\'s invitation, so forgive me if I\\'m mistaken, but you must be the representative. The IPC\\'s elite certainly does have an extraordinary air about them. I suppose such an exceptional figure such as yourself wouldn\\'t mind paving a convenience for us?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I must be hearing things: Paving a convenience? Shouldn\\'t I be saying this to you instead?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I\\'ve been waiting here for more than ten minutes. Do you know how many credits ten minutes is worth to me?\\n▶ **Himeko:** It must be an inordinate number, which is why, now, Mr. Aventurine, I have an investment that you absolutely cannot miss out on.\\n▶ ▶ **Himeko:** The IPC\\'s influence runs deep and wide, and their word wields the utmost authority. We hope to borrow your status to vouch for (him/her).\\n▶ **Himeko:** As such, you won\\'t just be sparing much of your invaluable time but also forging new friendships.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Well, this is interesting. And how will my new friends benefit me?\\n▶ **Himeko:** Now this is a topic very much worth getting into. Just as we are guests of the Watchmaker, why don\\'t we make ourselves comfortable in Penacony before getting to know each other more elaborately?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Sounds good. But Ms. Navigator, I must point out that—\\n▶ **Aventurine:** If I do something about it now, the time saved is from my own effort, not a favor from you all.\\n▶ **Himeko:** ...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...But what you said in the second half, I loved it! Friends, yes — nothing is more precious than friends, especially a righteous Trailblazer like a Nameless.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Going forward on this Penacony trip, I\\'ll be counting on all my \"Trailblazer\" friends here. Looking forward to a delightful time with you all.\\n▶ **Himeko:** I\\'m glad you\\'ve put it this way. So about the vouching...\\n▶ ▶ **Aventurine:** There you go, Miss. Please allow (him/her) to check in on my account.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I have an appointment with The Family\\'s Mr. Sunday. I will ask him to handle this matter later.

Now we\\'re truly acquainted.\\n You have no idea what friends are.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Such integrity, I like it! I must have you as a friend — here, 20,000 credits!\\n It\\'s fine, I don\\'t mind it.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** My apologies for any perceived slight. To show my sincerity, I offer you 10,000 credits as a gesture of goodwill.\\n Then I\\'ll gladly accept it.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** That\\'s the spirit! Nothing should come between friends. Tell me whatever you need, it\\'s on my tab.\\n Thank you, but we can spare the gifts.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** How upright, I like you! I must have you as a friend — here, 20,000 credits!\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Please excuse me, I have some matters to attend to, so I must depart, but I\\'m sure we\\'ll meet again soon.\\n(Obtain  Credit ×10,000 or  Credit ×20,000)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Approach Robin)\\n▶ **March 7th:** Wait a minute, I\\'m sorry, but are you... the...?\\n▶ **March 7th:** The singer, Epsilon\\'s superstar... *If I Can Stop One Heart From Breaking*. That\\'s your song, isn\\'t it?\\n▶ **Robin:** I never thought a cutie like yourself would be a fan of mine.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Ahh, it really is Robin! To run into her in person here...\\n▶ **Robin:** It is an honor to meet everyone.\\n▶ **Welt:** Are you also a member of The Family on Penacony like him?\\n▶ **Robin:** Truth be told, I am a guest like everyone. Penacony is my hometown, but I left when I was older. I was graciously invited this time to return and sing a song at the Charmony Festival.\\n▶ **Robin:** The person you speak of is Sunday, my senior, and one of the local leaders of Penacony. He is also the organizer of this era\\'s Charmony Festival. He heard you all ran into some difficulties, and sent me here to provide aid.\\n▶ **Robin:** Alas, I arrived a little later than usual. I sincerely apologize for any unpleasantness during your stay.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Please be at ease, I have instructed Miss Alley to resolve the system error as soon as possible. I have also upgraded your rooms as token compensation. Please wait a moment for the hotel to arrange for suitable accommodation.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Sunday:** Mr. Aventurine has an appointment with the Oak Family, and has checked in prior. On his behalf, I extend his apologies to everyone of the Astral Express, and wish for an amicable partnership moving forward.\\n▶ **Welt:** Thank you for stepping in to resolve this matter, but are you sure about the rooms? I wouldn\\'t want your other guests to feel we were being given preferential treatment...\\n▶ **Sunday:** Please rest assured that The Family will personally undertake communications to handle this. It is only right that we — as the actual administrators — relieve you of any problems during your visit in Penacony.\\n▶ **Sunday:** I apologize for taking up everyone\\'s precious time, and we shan\\'t keep you any longer. If you need anything else while in Penacony, The Family stands ready to serve.\\n▶ **Robin:** May your dreams be beautiful and pleasant.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **March 7th:** \\\\*sigh\\\\* It\\'s just one surprise after another. But since that mister... which day was he? Sunday. Since Mr. Sunday has vouched for us, I guess we can finally check in normally?\\n I\\'m already a little winded.\\n▶ **March 7th:** You and me both! I can\\'t wait to get inside and just flop and roll on that comfy bed...\\n▶ **Himeko:** You\\'ll have to wait for us to finish checking in first.\\n I hope we don\\'t run into any more trouble.\\n▶ **March 7th:** How does the saying go? \"Trouble comes in pairs\"...\\n▶ **Himeko:** There\\'s also the saying: \"From misfortune comes bliss.\"\\n Are all The Family names so strange?\\n▶ **March 7th:** This is just a stage name... I guess?\\n▶ **Himeko:** I thought so too. It\\'s most likely some rule of Penacony\\'s, or The Family\\'s.\\n▶ **Himeko:** Okay, there\\'s no queue in the lobby now. Let\\'s go find Miss Alley...\\n\\n### Go to the hotel front desk and check in again\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nSunday and Robin assured the Crew in the name of \"The Family\"... Honestly, was such a small matter worth all of that fuss?  \\nEither way, their pleasant attitudes at least showed that the service in this hotel was a cut above. The Crew should have no trouble enjoying their holiday here.  \\nAs the storm has settled, it\\'s time to retry the check\\\\-in process with Miss Alley... Hopefully, things go smoothly this time.

I heard that Penacony transformed the dreamscape into a majestic metropolis...\\n▶ **March 7th:** What exactly would that look like? I can\\'t wait!\\n\\n### Go to the public rest area\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nYou collect your Dreamscape Pass from Miss Alley, which means that the lengthy check\\\\-in process is finally coming to an end.  \\nNow, you are only one step from entering your dreams. Pass down the corridor and head to the public rest area. The Reverie (Reality)\\n\\n(While walking)\\n▶ **Himeko:** Our rooms are down this way.\\n▶ **Welt:** This is a long hallway... Is it just me, or is this hotel too big for its own good?\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Approach marked location)\\n▶ **Himeko:** We\\'re finally here. Let\\'s all head to our rooms first and put down our bags.\\n▶ **Himeko:** Welt, how about a drink first? Penacony\\'s SoulGlad is very famous.\\n▶ **Welt:** ...Go on. We may be thinking of the same thing.\\n▶ **Himeko:** Do you remember the invite that the Express received?\\n▶ **Welt:** \"The Family\\'s esteemed guests are cordially invited to Penacony to participate in our grand celebration.\" That\\'s why we\\'re here in the first place.\\n▶ **Himeko:** You recall correctly, but there was more to this invite.\\n▶ **Himeko:** \"...Witness the impossible in the realm of dreams, find the Legacy of the Watchmaker, Father of Penacony, and thus the answer to the question: Why does life slumber.\"\\n▶ **Welt:** I don\\'t remember that part of the invite... You mean, there was a hidden message?\\n▶ **Himeko:** This is the part that intrigues me — the invite sent by The Family was nothing more than a music box that, when wound, would play an accompanying tune.\\n▶ **Himeko:** But the box that was sent to us was slightly unusual... The music it played had off\\\\-key notes in the background.\\n▶ **Himeko:** I recorded these dissonant notes, and they were a perfect match with the gravity wave frequency when the Express made its warp jump. Also, the Express engine\\'s spatial curvature was its encryption key.\\n▶ **Welt:** ...A distress call method regularly used by the Nameless.\\n▶ **Himeko:** I can\\'t be certain. It may be a Masked Fool\\'s trap. From the execution itself, the Riddlers or Inquisition Spirits could have done this themselves.\\n▶ **Welt:** When did you discover this?\\n▶ **Himeko:** When we were handling that Luofu Stellaron matter. I told Pom\\\\-Pom about it first thing.\\n▶ **Welt:** It\\'s no wonder that IPC ambassador also mentioned this \"Watchmaker.\" The invite he received must also have contained a hidden message, and it seems like he decoded it.\\n▶ **Welt:** ...There\\'s something else on my mind. When the invite was brought up, that Family leader mentioned being one of the \"actual administrators\" of Penacony, and that it was their duty to \"relieve\" us of any problems.\\n▶ **Welt:** In hindsight, there was more to that statement. He also had Miss Robin with him... I\\'m no singer, but her voice sounded a little strange... Would a singer really take to the stage if their voice wasn\\'t in top shape?\\n▶ **Himeko:** Are you saying... you suspect that The Family did not send the invite, and... is hiding something from us?\\n▶ **Welt:** It\\'s possible. The fact that The Family sent out invites to the other factions is already unusual. And your discovery confirms that there could be a third party involved... I take back what I said: This \"event\" is becoming more interesting with each passing second.\\n▶ **Welt:** Why didn\\'t you tell the others?\\n▶ **Himeko:** We shouldn\\'t interfere if this is just an internal affair of Penacony or The Family.\\n▶ **Welt:** But you said so yourself: This could concern the Trailblaze.\\n▶ **Himeko:** Well, I did, which is why...\\n▶ **Himeko:** ...before we set off, I told March 7th and Dan Heng about this.\\n▶ **Welt:** So I was the only one kept in the dark then.\\n I too just found out about the invite thingy...\\n▶ **March 7th:** That\\'s because you were zonked out the whole ride. No one had the chance to tell you.\\n Time to get involved.\\n Ain\\'t no biggie when Galactic Baseballer is in the house!\\n▶ **Welt:** Penacony\\'s situation is getting complicated. Let\\'s tread lightly.\\n▶ **Himeko:** Who sent the invite, what is the purpose of gathering all the factions into Penacony, and why does The Family choose to remain silent about their knowledge of this... There are too many unanswered questions. We must use the utmost caution before we go deeper.\\n▶ **Himeko:** Right now, let\\'s just focus on the conductor\\'s request: We\\'ll collect intel while enjoying this \"wonderful vacation.\" Penacony is, after all, a famed resort of the cosmos. Not many get a chance to even visit in their lifetime.\\n\\n### Return to your room and prepare to enter the dream\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn the public rest area, Himeko expresses concern about the strange appearance of the invitation, but she said that the most important thing right now is to \"enjoy a pleasant vacation.\"  \\nNow, it is finally time to enter the dream... But you can speak with your companions beforehand if you like. The Reverie (Reality)\\n\\n▶ **Himeko:** Head back to your rooms, get some rest, and prepare to enter the dreamscape.\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (It\\'s time to head back to my room... Before entering the dream, I should probably talk to the rest.)\\n\\n#### (Optional) Speak with the Crew\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n\\n(Talk to Welt, optional)\\n▶ **Welt:** The decor in here\\'s a little... loud for my tastes. So this is how astral high society does things, huh...?\\n About the Watchmaker...\\n▶ **Welt:** They say he\\'s a historically important figure in Penacony, and tales of his life have been handed down over generations. Such tales encourage believers to come to the Planet of Festivities to pursue their dreams. He\\'s an interesting fellow, that\\'s for sure, and his legacy still has the power to draw people in.\\n▶ **Welt:** But how and why he\\'s involved with that invite, and why his name popped up in the encrypted message allegedly sent by a Nameless... I\\'ve got no leads for now.\\n About The Family...\\n▶ **Welt:** The Family believes in the Harmony, and their altruism is well\\\\-known across the stars — a trait that is intimately tied to Penacony\\'s stability and prosperity.\\n▶ **Welt:** But some factions have always been wary of The Family — suspecting that their benevolence and eloquence belie an ulterior motive... So far, it seems to me that The Family treats their guests with courtesy, so I don\\'t think we need to worry about that for now.\\n About the dream journey...\\n▶ **Welt:** The dream Penacony is divided into twelve moments. Personally, I\\'m interested in the Moment of Sol — it\\'s a visual dreamscape steeped in Penacony\\'s history and civilization.\\n▶ **Welt:** Penacony\\'s Grand Museum, the Primal Waking Library, the Paperfold academy... The pasts that we chase may be stored in these places.\\n That\\'s enough chit\\\\-chat for now.\\n▶ **Welt:** Past the guest room\\'s Dreampool is the real Penacony. Let\\'s get ready to move out. Pleasant dreams.\\n(Talk to Himeko, optional)\\n▶ **Himeko:** What\\'s wrong? Not turning in? Can\\'t find your room, or do you have something on your mind?\\n About the Watchmaker...\\n▶ **Himeko:** One can\\'t discuss the Planet of Festivities without mentioning the Watchmaker — Penacony\\'s household name and figure. Fortune, fame, status... He built everyone\\'s futures with his bare hands, and became the symbol of dreams.\\n▶ **Himeko:** But the veracity of these stories... remains untraceable. Many have their own opinions on the Watchmaker\\'s origin and past, and there are even some who suspect he is a conceptual construct of The Family.\\n▶ **Himeko:** For now, I do not think this invite is linked to the Watchmaker. His legacy... It sounds more like a marketing hook to drum up more traffic, if nothing else.\\n About that IPC representative...\\n▶ **Himeko:** An IPC ambassador who knows more than he lets on, a silver\\\\-tongued businessman, a flamboyant and debonair aristocrat... He could be all of them. My instincts tell me he\\'s much more than meets the eye.\\n▶ **Himeko:** Before the dust settles, we should maintain amicable relations with all camps, while keeping our guards up.\\n About the dream journey...\\n▶ **Himeko:** The dream Penacony is divided into twelve individual dreamscapes. I\\'ve heard that the destinations vary for different people when they first enter the dream.\\n▶ **Himeko:** As for me... I look forward to the Moment of Scorchsand — its wild winds, taverns, and festive choicesSoulGlad™ Festivity Auditions • Scorchsand Venue have more of a Nameless Trailblaze vibe. The Moment of Morning Dew is also a decent choice — I can use that chance to visit The Family.\\n That\\'s enough chit\\\\-chat for now.\\n▶ **Himeko:** You must be exhausted from everything that\\'s happened so far. Even if you\\'re Trailblazing, you mustn\\'t forget to relax. Goodnight, and sweet dreams.\\n(After talking to Welt and Himeko)\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (Where\\'s March 7th? Has she returned to her room already?)\\n(While walking towards room)\\n▶ **March 7th:** Woah! What a big bathtub...\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (Odd... Why\\'s my room door open?)\\n(Investigate door to March 7th\\'s room, optional)\\n▶ **March 7th:** Can\\'t sleep from all the excitement, huh? I can\\'t wait to experience the dream world!\\n Where are you thinking of going?\\n▶ **March 7th:** The Moment of Dusk, obviously! How can you not visit the shopping paradise when you\\'re at the resort of all resorts! I\\'m all ready to fill my bags to the brim!\\n▶ **March 7th:** Hmm... After doing my shopping, I\\'ll get all dolled up in an evening gown to attend Miss Robin\\'s show at Penacony Grand Theater!\\n About Robin...\\n▶ **March 7th:** You know, it\\'s weird. Welt noticed it too, about how Miss Robin\\'s voice sounded somewhat weary... I can\\'t quite put my finger on it, but it was different than usual?\\n▶ **March 7th:** Could she be tired out from her Cosmic Concert Tour? Insisting on performing under such circumstances, Miss Robin is a superstar among celebrities!\\n About the event...\\n▶ **March 7th:** Here I was, thinking of some good ol\\' relaxation, but nope! This \"event\" is a wild ride! The various factions deciphering the riddle, a power struggle of past legacies — feels like we\\'re in a live\\\\-action detective saga!\\n▶ **March 7th:** Who knows, maybe we\\'ll even witness classic scenarios like family feuds, tragic losses, worlds torn apart, espionage situations, rivers running red with blood, stuff like that! This is simply too thrilling...\\n You\\'ve got quite the active imagination.\\n That sounds scary.\\n I too wanna see a river of blood!\\n▶ **March 7th:** Just kidding, how could that be possible?\\n That\\'s enough chit\\\\-chat for now.\\n▶ **March 7th:** Don\\'t worry, Welt and Himeko will have our backs if things go wrong. Let\\'s just make the most of it all while we\\'re here.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Enter the room)\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (Hmm? He\\'s...)\\n(Approach Aventurine)\\n▶ **Aventurine:** How fortuitous, we meet again.\\n This is my room. What are you doing here?\\n Is this your room...?\\n We meet again, friend!\\n▶ **Aventurine:** That\\'s right, pal!\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Calm down, I\\'m just here to soak in the festive vibe. This may be your room now, but half a system hour ago, it was still mine.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** A lucky block number, a lucky floor, a lucky room number. You have no idea how much I went through to book this precious space... And now I\\'ve given it to you. Treasure it well, friend.\\n You were the one who transferred it to me?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Of course. What, you thought The Family acted simply out of their own good will?\\n You were the one who arranged the check\\\\-in?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** No no, I only let you have my room.\\n Well, it doesn\\'t matter. You need to leave.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I\\'m not sure I like that tone...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Penacony\\'s a true\\\\-blue land of dreams. How many across the stars would spend half their lives, just to acquire an admission ticket into The Reverie?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Think about the type of people who can even afford to stay here. If it wasn\\'t for my brilliant plan, you think The Family would offend those bigwigs, just to sate the paltry whims of an unsought guest such as yourself?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** So sit down, and let\\'s have a chat. With everything said and done, I think I deserve at least this much, right?\\n What do you want to talk about?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Cutting to the chase, I like that.\\n You should go talk to Himeko or Welt.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Wrong. You\\'re the one I seek.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Simply put, my friend, I need your help. You may or may not know this, but Penacony\\'s far murkier than it seems. The Family\\'s eyes are everywhere, but you get the drift.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** My goal is simple: Help the IPC retrieve some things that belonged to them in the first place. If you agree, when this is done, you will stand to reap great rewards, as well as the Preservation\\'s protection.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** It\\'s clear you\\'re not just one of the crowd. You possess a distinct quality, so magnetic that it could sway the outcome of any game. That \\\\*power\\\\*, you really don\\'t wish to use it? Or... you don\\'t want to be rid of it? Why not use it to etch your name across the stars?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** The power that men both fear and desire is right in the palms of your hands...\\n▶ ▶ **Aventurine:** ...(Mr./Miss) Stellaron, have I hit the nail on the head?\\n How did you know?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I know now.\\n I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Your acting\\'s good, I like that.\\n I\\'m warning you, you need to leave now.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Warning me! Hahaha, you\\'re too funny.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** You don\\'t have to answer me now. Sit on it for a while. When the time is right, I will look for you again.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Of course, you can confer with your colleagues as well, or go as far as to use me in turn — I welcome that notion. Because it will also show me your true value.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I don\\'t do deals where I\\'m on the losing end. So, I hope that \"friends\"... don\\'t let me down.\\n I will think about it.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Mm, very well.\\n I cannot make this decision on my own.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I already said there\\'s no rush to give me an answer. Because no matter what happens... the outcome will remain the same.\\n You should really be going.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I already said there\\'s no rush to give me an answer. Because no matter what happens... the outcome will remain the same.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Oh yes, before I go, let\\'s play another game — a simple game, to get to know each other better. You just have to guess which hand the chip is hiding in. It\\'ll help you get a better grasp on my personality, and the way I do things...\\n**Ding— A chip is tossed into the air, and in the blink of an eye, it disappears, replaced by two clenched fists held out in front of you.**\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Left or right? Get ready, I\\'m about to reveal the answer.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Oh, I didn\\'t get your answer. But that\\'s fine, because...\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Cutscene plays)\\n\\n**Aventurine:** Friend, the game has already begun.\\n**Aventurine:** Allow me to make you an offer —\\n**Aventurine:** ...one you can\\'t refuse.\\n**Aventurine:** No reason to choose otherwise...\\n**Aventurine:** ...and no other choice.\\n**Acheron:** Hello there.\\n**Acheron:** What are you doing in my room?\\n(Cutscene ends)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Your room?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Well played, friend. You haven\\'t been in Penacony long, but you already know how to rope people in to your cause.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Don\\'t misunderstand, that was a mere reminder. This place runs deep, with plenty of unsavory characters. Don\\'t forget to stay on your toes. Like... keeping your door closed.\\n▶ ▶ **Aventurine:** I\\'ll make my exit now, (Trailblazer)! Have a pleasant stay.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...\\n Thank you.\\n You are...?\\n Have we met somewhere...\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...Why haven\\'t you left?\\n ...Eh?\\n▶ **Acheron:** I said, why haven\\'t you left?\\n This is my room.\\n▶ **Acheron:** This is my room.\\n Why haven\\'t you left?\\n▶ **Acheron:** Why do I have to?\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...\\n(Version 1\\\\)\\n\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...Have I come to the wrong room? This can\\'t be. Before I said anything, I even made sure that I had the right room number...\\n (Huh...?)\\n▶ **Acheron:** Do I have the wrong wing... or even the wrong block? I\\'m sorry, this hotel is huge, and the hallways all look the same. It\\'s easy to get lost in here...\\n(Version 2\\\\)\\n\\n▶ **Acheron:** I jest. Take it easy, this is indeed your room. I was just passing by...\\n (Huh...?)\\n▶ **Acheron:** I\\'m trying to find my own room too, and I heard a commotion here... so I came to take a look. Luckily your door was open, or it could\\'ve gotten dangerous. That man looked like he was up to no good.\\n(Version 3\\\\)\\n\\n▶ **Acheron:** I was just teasing, please forgive me. This is indeed your room. I saw that man snooping about while I was in the hallway, it didn\\'t seem like he was searching for his own room, so it made me wary...\\n (Huh...?)\\n▶ **Acheron:** I later saw you walking into the same room, so I began to connect the dots. The situation got a bit tense... I hope you don\\'t mind that I pulled this stunt.\\n (I have a strange feeling about this...)\\n▶ **Acheron:** Anyway, as long as you\\'re all right. I should return to my room too.\\n▶ **Acheron:** But before I go, can I ask you a question? You may think it somewhat strange, perhaps even rude, but I wish to know...\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...Have we met somewhere before?\\n I was about to ask too...\\n Woah, déjà vu...\\n Perhaps in a dream...\\n Probably not.\\n(Version 1\\\\)\\n\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...Is that so? I haven\\'t been able to shake off this familiar feeling since just now... Maybe this is what they call déjà vu, hehe. Or it could purely be serendipity.\\n(Version 2\\\\)\\n\\n▶ **Acheron:** This may sound embarrassing, because I would sometimes forget stuff I really shouldn\\'t have from past experiences... It\\'s just a habit of mine, don\\'t mind me.\\n(Version 3\\\\)\\n\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...Yes, it was a dream. I had a dream on my way here, and I think you were in it... A blink of a thought in my head...\\n▶ ▶ **Acheron:** (Trailblazer), this is your name, isn\\'t it? Pleased to meet you.\\n How do you know?\\n Do you still remember me?\\n I\\'m that famous now?\\n▶ **Acheron:** \\\\*smiles\\\\* You forget, that man mentioned it before he left. My memory\\'s not very good, but it\\'s not so bad that I can\\'t remember details from just minutes ago.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Galaxy Ranger, Acheron... This is what they call me. You can call me whatever you want. We will likely meet again.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Lastly, a gentle reminder... There are people who possess unwavering resolution and faith, even unto death, and they do not wield such conviction for good. And on that man\\'s face, I see such a similar expression.\\n▶ **Acheron:** One who wears a blade must use it to cut eventually. And when a gambler has nothing to lose on the table, he will surely go for broke and bet it all on a final hand... That is all I can say.\\n▶ **Acheron:** I thought you should know all this before making a choice. Goodbye.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (Acheron left... Strange... I can\\'t shake off this odd feeling I have...)\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (Forget it. It\\'s taken a while, but at least I can finally enter the dream... Hmm?)\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...\\n Why\\'re you back?\\n Is there something else?\\n It didn\\'t take long for a reunion.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Mmm...\\n▶ **Acheron:** Sorry, can you point me in the direction of the lobby? All these hallways really look the same to me...\\n ...\\nYou show Acheron the way, she thanks you again and again.\\n(Obtain  Aventurine\\'s Token and  Acheron (Dreamscape Pass Sticker))\\n\\n### Enter the dream in the Dreampool\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nYou have finally made it through the series of mysterious encounters standing between you and entering the dream.

The Family\\'s been rummaging through your things, haven\\'t they?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Yeah, by that gray\\\\-suited fellow. All the cash gifts, and the box containing the Cornerstones... Eh? Where\\'re you going?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Back home, to tell the corporation that some idiot ruined everything.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** It\\'s nothing more than a few rocks, why so serious? Who cares if they\\'re gone?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Without that aventurine stone, you\\'re nothing more than a doomed Sigonian thrall sentenced to die by the IPC. Or is that serial number on your neck a cherished memento from the Amber Lord?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Hah, you\\'re funny, I\\'ll give you that! It appears our erudite friend has done his homework.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** It\\'s my job. How would a gambler wrest PenaconyFrontier Prison back for the IPC otherwise?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Don\\'t worry, Doctor, I have my ways. The Family fears interference from the IPC, hence their constant intervention... Or, to play devil\\'s advocate, perhaps Penacony might have always been a ruse under the guise of \"the Harmony?\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** If you ask me, that invite is nothing but a self\\\\-planted diversion, a red herring. Or maybe they\\'re thinking of pulling off something big during the Charmony Festival...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Or someone else made the invite, and they acquiesced to elevating the magnitude of the plan. Regardless — be it The Family or the Watchmaker\\'s Legacy, as long as they\\'re all useful to me.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Get to the point. What\\'s your plan?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** No need to expand on that now. It\\'s not yet time to reveal my trump card.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** Damned gambler. Any true collaboration demands trust. Did that notion somehow escape your Sigonian upbringing?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Then, do you trust me?\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** That depends on you.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** So you don\\'t trust me either. Now that was easy, wasn\\'t it? Also, I didn\\'t go to school, and my parents didn\\'t teach me any of that. A pity, they left before they could impart any life lessons.\\n▶ **Dr. Ratio:** ...I did not mean to offend.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I\\'m not offended. But they did teach me that friends are weapons of the Avgins. Even under the watchful eye of the Harmony, we need as many friends as we can get.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Let\\'s see, the Garden of Recollection and the Astral Express have already made contact. The Annihilation Gang... I can\\'t really count on them. The Knights of Beauty haven\\'t given their answer, and as for that bunch at the Tavern...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Speaking of which, I ran into a woman just now who introduced herself as a Galaxy Ranger. The whole conversation felt off. Help me look into her...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Huh?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...You don\\'t really disdain me that much, do you? Well, seems like I\\'m on my own again.\\n\\n### Investigate the unfamiliar room\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\nUnder the guidance of a sweet voice, your thoughts grow clouded and flowing, transcending reality along with the smoke that fills your room, as you arrive in a Dreamscape created from a \"Memory Zone.\" However, the scene you find before you is not a beautiful dream.

I\\'m here to provide guidance to our guests.\\n We meet again.\\n▶ **Misha:** Huh, you remember me? I\\'m so glad.\\n This whole place looks weird.\\n▶ **Misha:** This is a temporary interchange, so it looks a little rundown... The Reverie in the dreamscape is currently undergoing a revamp.\\n▶ **Misha:** I apologize for any unpleasantness in your stay... but if you enter the Golden Hour, I\\'m sure all your troubles will dissipate in an instant!\\n What happened to The Reverie?\\n▶ **Misha:** You\\'re asking about The Reverie in the dreamscape, right? I\\'m not sure exactly either, I\\'m sorry...\\n What is \"Golden Hour?\"\\n▶ **Misha:** You\\'ve perhaps read about it in your Dreamscape Pass, but I can explain one more time!\\n▶ **Misha:** Golden Hour is one of the twelve dreamscapes in Penacony, and its time coincides with midnight. Here, the dream\\'s time is forever stuck in the moment before midnight. Tomorrow will not come, and this night of revelry will never end...\\n▶ **Misha:** ...Ah, but that doesn\\'t mean that time has stopped in the dream. To avoid any physical or mental burden on guests, time in the dream has been synced with reality\\'s, so don\\'t worry!\\n I just picked up a note...\\n▶ **Misha:** Note? Did you find it in the room?\\n▶ **Misha:** Ah... It wasn\\'t trash left behind by the previous guest, was it...?\\n▶ **Misha:** It was my mistake — I failed to tidy up properly, and caused an inconvenience for you... I\\'m truly sorry!\\n How do I get to Golden Hour?\\n▶ **Misha:** You just go right through that door to reach Golden Hour. I wish you an unforgettable dream!\\n(Talk to Misha again, optional)\\n▶ **Misha:** Right through that doorway is Golden Hour. If you\\'ve any other questions, I\\'m more than happy to answer them!\\n What happened to The Reverie?\\n▶ **Misha:** You\\'re asking about The Reverie in the dreamscape, right? I\\'m not sure exactly either, I\\'m sorry...\\n What is \"Golden Hour?\"\\n▶ **Misha:** You\\'ve perhaps read about it in your Dreamscape Pass, but I can explain one more time!\\n▶ **Misha:** Golden Hour is one of the twelve dreamscapes in Penacony, and its time coincides with midnight.

Are you alright?\\n The fall didn\\'t hurt at all!\\n▶ **Robin:** Hehe, well you are in the Dreamscape, after all.\\n I think I\\'m hallucinating...\\n▶ **Robin:** Hehe, that\\'s a normal reaction for first\\\\-time visitors to the Dreamscape.\\n Are we in Heaven... Or?\\n▶ **Robin:** Haha, there\\'s nothing to worry about — you\\'ve arrived at the Dreamscape.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Seems like our guest here hasn\\'t gotten used to the transition.

She smiles, and you see ripples shimmering in the depths of her lake\\\\-green eyes, followed by a mighty vortex emerging from the depths of the pool.\\nYour vision dims as your body dissolves, becoming one with the fluidity of the time\\\\-space.

(Trailblazer), welcome to Penacony.\\n What does that mean? What did you just do to me?\\n▶ **Robin:** I\\'ve merely changed your state of mind for you to feel more at ease.\\n Did you just brainwash me...\\n▶ **Robin:** I\\'ve merely changed your state of mind for you to feel more at ease.\\n What was that sound just now...\\n▶ **Robin:** It was a song with a harmonic tune.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Relax. Just did some tuning on you with the resonance of the Harmony to allow you to control your limbs freely in the Dreamscape.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Essentially, the dream of Penacony is a world formed by memoria. Only by fully understanding its nature can you move freely within it.\\n▶ **Sunday:** It\\'s like learning to swim — it\\'s easy to sink at first when you aren\\'t accustomed to the water, but once you get the hang of it you can float and swim on the surface effortlessly.\\n That\\'s a great analogy. I get it now.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Thanks for the compliment. In fact, we don\\'t really have an in\\\\-depth understanding of the memoria.\\n This is deep...\\n▶ **Sunday:** Indeed. But still, we don\\'t really have an in\\\\-depth understanding of the memoria.\\n Does that mean I can levitate in the air?\\n▶ **Sunday:** Theoretically, you can, but it would be very difficult to pull off. After all, we don\\'t really have an in\\\\-depth understanding of the memoria yet.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Unless you\\'re one of the Memokeepers of the Garden of Recollection, it can be difficult at first to manipulate the memoria as you wish. But once you\\'ve been tuned by the Harmony, you can use the same laws of physics from the real world to understand how the dream world works.\\n▶ **Sunday:** Oops... I\\'ve fallen into my professional habits again. I just can\\'t seem to shake off this urge to be a know\\\\-it\\\\-all.\\n▶ **Robin:** Don\\'t mind him — he\\'s always like that.

It\\'s all StoneBoss\\'s fault that things have turned out this way!\\n▶ **Clockie:** Of all the lowlifes in Dreamville, StoneBoss\\'s the worst.

Was I crazy?\\n▶ **Gang Members:** What\\'s wrong with boss?\\n▶ **Gangster Boss:** Hey, may I ask you a question? Were you the one who made me simmer down earlier? I wasn\\'t my normal self..\\n It\\'s the least I can do.\\n▶ **Gangster Boss:** Thanks for doing that. If we\\'d laid a finger on our guests just now, we would\\'ve faced severe punishment from the Bloodhound Family.\\n Wow, you\\'ve become so well\\\\-mannered.\\n▶ **Gangster Boss:** We owe it to you — if we\\'d laid a finger on our guests just now, we would\\'ve faced severe punishment from the Bloodhound Family.\\n▶ **Gangster Boss:** I\\'m so sorry for stirring up all this trouble... Alas, why did I get so worked up all of a sudden? It\\'s baffling...\\n▶ **Clockie:** Oh, my gray friend! You have to tell him that StoneBoss is behind this!\\n Everyone loses it once in a while.\\n▶ **Gangster Boss:** This is embarrassing... I feel bad for causing such a spectacle.\\n Perhaps, it\\'s because we\\'re all in a dream.\\n▶ **Gangster Boss:** Haha, that can be one of the reasons.\\n It\\'s Boss Stone\\'s doing. Can you believe it?\\n▶ **Gangster Boss:** Stone? Um, I\\'m not sure I get what you mean...\\n▶ **Gangster Boss:** Anyway, I owe everyone a proper apology. Gang, line up and say sorry to our honored guests!\\n▶ **Gang Members:** S—Sure!\\n▶ **Gangster Boss:** Ready...

You sure I pulled that off?\\n▶ **Clockie:** It... must have been? Otherwise, why would he be in tears all of a sudden?\\n▶ **Gangster Boss:** \\\\*sob\\\\*... \\\\*sob\\\\*...\\n▶ **Gang Members:** What\\'s wrong with boss?\\n▶ **Clockie:** Oh, he\\'s crying so hard. Even I, the guardian of the Dreamville, am nearly moved to tears.\\n What\\'s wrong sweetie? Why are you feeling so down?\\n▶ **Gangster Boss:** \\\\*sob\\\\*... I... thought about my mother on my home planet...\\n Bruh, quit the waterworks. You\\'re a big boy now.\\n▶ **Gangster Boss:** \\\\*sob\\\\*... I... thought about my mother on my home planet...\\n Oh dear me, ain\\'t I a big bad meanie for making you sob like a crybaby?\\n▶ **Gangster Boss:** \\\\*sob\\\\*... It isn\\'t your fault. I just suddenly... thought about my mother on my home planet...\\n▶ **Gang Members:** What do we do now?\\n▶ **Clockie:** Woah, things are turning into a mess. But then again, maybe now is a good chance to ask them to leave?\\n My friend, why don\\'t you go and...\\n How about you get some alone time somewhere?\\n▶ **Gangster Boss:** \\\\*sob\\\\*... You\\'re right...\\n▶ **Gangster Boss:** \\\\*sob\\\\*... Gang, you are dismissed... I need to be alone for a while...\\n▶ **Gang Members:** Yes, boss!\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Misha:** We meet again! Are you the one who helped settle everything down here?\\n▶ **Clockie:** Misha, are you acquainted with this gray friend of mine?\\n▶ ▶ **Misha:** (He/She)\\'s an esteemed guest whom I\\'ve befriended recently. I told you about (him/her) before. Does it ring a bell?\\n▶ ▶ **Clockie:** Oh, it\\'s (him/her)!\\n▶ **Misha:** Anyway, thanks a lot! If you hadn\\'t gotten here in time, I would have been in a real mess...\\n▶ ▶ **Acheron:** Thank you, (Trailblazer). I\\'m surprised we get to see each other again so soon.\\n No need to thank me. It\\'s the least I can do.\\n I\\'m surprised too.\\n▶ **Acheron:** About all the commotion just now... I heard a bunch of Masked Fools were causing a ruckus on the streets. I happened to be passing through, got stopped for questioning, and there were some... misunderstandings along the way. Anyway, I owe you another one.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Is this lady... your friend too?\\n▶ ▶ **Acheron:** Well, we\\'ve only met each other once before. But (he/she) is a kind soul for helping me at the hotel.\\n▶ **Acheron:** It\\'s my pleasure to meet you, beautiful lady.\\n▶ **Firefly:** B—Beautiful lady...\\n▶ **Acheron:** By the way, what did you do to that man earlier? It was like someone took him on an emotional roller coaster.\\n▶ **Firefly:** I was wondering about that too... What happened back there, exactly?\\n Clockie taught me some Clockwork.\\n▶ **Clockie:** That\\'s right! It was me, Clockie!\\n▶ **Clockie:** Of course, you played a big part too. Without you doing the Clockwork, Dreamville would\\'ve been in some real trouble!\\n Talk therapy. I used that on him.\\n▶ **Clockie:** What\\'re you talking about? It wasn\\'t talk therapy! It was Clockwork!\\n▶ **Acheron:** I don\\'t think it\\'s that simple.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Could it have something to do with... That Clockie that only you can see?\\n It\\'s only natural for people to get intimidated by my baseball bat.\\n▶ **Clockie:** What\\'re you talking about? It wasn\\'t the baseball bat! It was Clockwork!\\n▶ **Acheron:** I don\\'t think it\\'s that simple.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Could it have something to do with... That Clockie that only you can see?\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...Clockie?\\n▶ **Firefly:** Yes, that cartoon character. I think he\\'s shown up in reality — I mean — in the Dreamscape.\\n▶ ▶ **Firefly:** I don\\'t really know how a cartoon character could show up around here, but according to (Trailblazer), only honest people with childlike innocence can see him...\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...\\n▶ **Acheron:** ...It seems like I\\'m too old to qualify for that.\\n▶ **Acheron:** If Clockie really exists, that can explain a lot of things.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Clockie:** Eh, can you see me too?\\n▶ **Acheron:** I can feel the presence of something inexplicable next to you, but it\\'s a shame that I can\\'t communicate with him like you can.\\n▶ **Acheron:** We can both perceive these extraordinary things in the dream, probably due to our ability to react to memoria. But you\\'re more attuned to it than I am.\\n▶ **Acheron:** I thought your heightened perception was caused by something the elegant Memokeeper might have left in your mind. Now, it seems to me there are many more special beings like her in this dream.\\n The elegant Memokeeper?\\n Who is she?\\n(Version 1\\\\)\\n\\n▶ **Acheron:** Shortly after we parted ways, I wandered into a ball without realizing it. A lady wearing a black veil invited me to dance. It was my first dance, and it was an unforgettable experience.\\n(Version 2\\\\)\\n\\n▶ **Acheron:** Shortly after we parted ways, I met a lady wearing a black veil who was also a guest at the hotel. We had a good time talking about the event over drinks.\\n(Version 3\\\\)\\n\\n▶ **Acheron:** Shortly after we parted ways, I felt someone\\'s spying eyes on me. I looked in the mirror and spotted a lady wearing a black veil. We had a deep conversation, but I won\\'t bore you with the details.\\n▶ **Acheron:** It\\'s a shame that I forgot to ask her for her name. I only know that she\\'s from the Garden of Recollection.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Garden of Recollection... Is it the group that serves the Aeon of Remembrance?\\n▶ **Acheron:** Exactly. They traverse freely between different worlds as memetic entities and are only visible to certain people. Doesn\\'t she sound very much like that Clockie you saw?\\n▶ **Acheron:** After all, it is a grand event held by The Family. The guestlist could be a lot longer than we imagine.\\n▶ **Acheron:** Once again, thank you for being kind to me. I wish you a great time in the dream, and I shall not interrupt your... date?\\n▶ **Firefly:** N—No! We\\'re not on a date!\\n▶ **Acheron:** Hehe.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Firefly:** ...She\\'s gone. Well, shall we?\\n▶ **Clockie:** I\\'ll let you get back to your beeswax. Thanks, my gray friend!\\n▶ **Misha:** I really appreciate your help! The Nameless are indeed a bunch of talented people... May our paths cross again!\\n▶ **Clockie:** May our paths cross again, tick\\\\-tock!\\n(Visitor Verification)\\n\\n(Misha has become a visitor to the Express.

What does that mean?\\n▶ **Firefly:** Just the literal meaning.\\n Do you want me... to crawl in there?\\n This is embarrassing. People are watching us...\\n▶ **Firefly:** It doesn\\'t matter! Anything can happen in a dream, and there are lots of people falling from the sky every day. The pedestrians aren\\'t going to be fazed by anything.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Let me show you how to do it. It\\'s going to be very dark at first, so you\\'ll have to stay close to me.\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** ...\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **???:** Hey, let me ask you something...\\n▶ **???:** Is following girls around like a lost puppy your way of getting their attention? You\\'ve been doing this for nearly half a system hour.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** To be more precise, it\\'s been 45 minutes. Time sure flies when you\\'re having fun, doesn\\'t it?\\n▶ **???:** \\\\*sigh\\\\* Spare me. Beautiful eyes though — are you from Sigonia?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Need another hint? I\\'m an AvginHoney.\\n▶ **???:** My eyes might not be as pretty as yours, but there\\'s no problem with my vision...\\n▶ **???:** You Sigonians are notorious throughout the entire universe! Liars, thieves, social manipulators, wolves in sheep\\'s clothing... You\\'re really living up to the reputation.\\n▶ **???:** I say you belong to the space under the manhole cover, not in a dream. There\\'s one right over there. Off you go!\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I\\'ll pass — the gloomy shade of a place like that just wouldn\\'t go with my vibe. Dreamville is frivolous, vain, and flashy — and that suits me just fine.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...Also, it never rains here! My outfit is too expensive to be exposed to the elements.\\n▶ **???:** Cut it out and go home, you slick talker. We are Fools, but we aren\\'t stupid. We aren\\'t interested in playing the friend game with the lapdogs of the IPC.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Really? You\\'ve never been friends with anyone from the IPC?\\n▶ **???:** Do you think I know nothing about the history of Penacony? Don\\'t drag me into your banal office politics.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Fool, you\\'ve been left with no choice since the moment you accepted the invitation to be here. You better pick a side while you have the chance, or else you\\'ll end up losing everything.\\n▶ **???:** You sound very sure of yourself. Looks like you\\'ve already convinced that Chicken Wing Boy from The Family.\\n▶ **???:** How did you do it, little peacock? Did you strip yourself naked, apologize to him on your knees, and promise that IPC would never harm Penacony?\\n▶ **???:** Friends? Oh, please. You guys only treat others as your bargaining chips.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** What\\'s wrong with chips? In any gamble, the only players that will never be on the losing side are the chips. My friends from the Garden of Recollection and Astral Express are all smart enough to understand that.\\n▶ **???:** But the smarter ones wouldn\\'t have joined the game in the first place. See? I\\'m smarter.\\n▶ **???:** Listen, little peacock. You\\'ve been invited by the Tavern before too. If you want the Masked Fools to get onboard, you need to figure out what it is The LaughterAha wants.\\n▶ **???:** Here\\'s a hint for you — Since you can\\'t convince anyone, why don\\'t you befriend a mute? At least, a mute won\\'t be able to refute your arguments. \\\\*laughs\\\\*\\n▶ **???:** So long!\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Thanks! I\\'ll keep your advice in mind!\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...What a pain in the neck.

Where is the sound coming from?)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Approach marked location)\\n▶ **Firefly:** Have you heard of the song? It\\'s called *If I Can Stop One Heart From Breaking*, by Robin. Her songs are played in the dreamland from time to time as the Charmony Festival is drawing close.\\n▶ **Firefly:** This spot is the closest place to the sky in the Dreamscape. It\\'s far from the hustle and bustle of the city and free from the bickering among the Dreamweavers. You can feel the moment — the scenery, the people, and the dreams — without being disturbed by anyone...\\n▶ **Firefly:** How beautiful... Time is frozen at this golden hour, this golden dream shared by the Fool from the Tavern and the Memokeeper from the Garden of Recollection, the wandering Ranger and the IPC ambassador, the Astral Express Nameless... and me.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Everyone falls asleep here equally, regardless of our different agendas...\\n▶ **Firefly:** ...\\n▶ **Firefly:** ... I\\'m sorry, (Trailblazer). I really am a stowaway.\\n I know.\\n▶ **Firefly:** I knew I couldn\\'t hide it from you.\\n I never saw that coming...\\n▶ **Firefly:** I think it\\'s only right to tell you.\\n▶ **Firefly:** My hometown was destroyed a long time ago. It was probably the doing of the Legion or the Swarm... I\\'m an interstellar refugee, just like many of the Penacony locals.\\n▶ **Firefly:** The Harmony accepts everyone, including wanderers from afar. The Family takes them in, but they... don\\'t belong here.\\n▶ **Firefly:** In this splendid metropolis, some have a dream called Penacony, but some have dreams... that are no different from reality, even though everyone who comes here harbors the same motive in the beginning.\\n▶ **Firefly:** And it\\'s likewise for me. I have a wish I want to achieve so badly in the real world, but I can\\'t. So, I want to give it a shot here...\\n I know the feel.\\n What\\'s your wish?\\n You can\\'t run away from reality.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Entropy Loss Syndrome. Have you heard of this term?\\n▶ **Firefly:** It\\'s a strange condition. Those suffering from it will experience an irreversible chronic dissociation of their physical structure. This means they will slowly fade away, and the process is barely noticeable to others...\\n▶ **Firefly:** You can still run, jump, and talk as usual. Everything seems normal, but then you\\'ll start doing everything slightly slower than others...\\n▶ **Firefly:** ...And then even slower than that, until the lines between your body and the entire world become blurry. You won\\'t be able to tell reality from dreams because they have all been shattered.\\n▶ **Firefly:** So, how could I possibly resist it... I mean can you imagine? I can actually free myself from this icy medical cabin in this dream...\\n▶ **Firefly:** I can forget about all the doctor\\'s advice. I can listen, and see, and touch, and think, and understand whatever I want with my body. So, although this world isn\\'t real, this experience is priceless...\\n▶ **Firefly:** ...Just like this moment.\\n▶ **Firefly:** I\\'m sorry. For certain reasons, there are things I can\\'t reveal to you yet. But there are also things you should know.\\n▶ **Firefly:** I am, in fact, after the Watchmaker\\'s Legacy, but that doesn\\'t mean we have to go our separate ways and be enemies. But at least... I hope things won\\'t turn out that way.\\n I hope so too.\\n▶ **Firefly:** ...Thanks.\\n I can\\'t make any promises.\\n▶ **Firefly:** ...It\\'s okay. Thanks.\\n I can\\'t put my trust in someone who hides things from me.\\n▶ **Firefly:** ...I understand, and I\\'m okay with that.\\n Who exactly are you?\\n▶ **Firefly:** I\\'ll tell you, but... not now.\\n▶ **Firefly:** In my dream, I saw a scorched earth, and a new sapling emerging from it. It bloomed against the morning sun, and whispered to me.\\n▶ **Firefly:** I still remember the question on the invitation letter — Why does life slumber?\\n▶ **Firefly:** You see, everything is possible in this land of dreams. The nightmarish past will disperse and fade away like bubbles in water, and the future that you don\\'t want to face will never come.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Why do people choose to sleep? I think...\\n▶ **Firefly:** It is because they\\'re afraid to wake up from the dream.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ **Firefly:** I\\'m sorry things are getting all bleak and serious... Let me see what I can do to lighten the mood.\\n▶ **Firefly:** I mean, don\\'t you have lots of friends on the Astral Express? What would you guys do if something like this happened?\\n Pom\\\\-Pom would cool us down with water from a spray can...\\n▶ **Firefly:** Spray can? That\\'s... rough.\\n▶ **Firefly:** Perhaps, there\\'s something else we can do?\\n Dan Heng would tell us dry jokes with a deadpan expression...\\n▶ **Firefly:** Jokes? Um, I... don\\'t really have a good sense of humor...\\n▶ **Firefly:** Perhaps, we can think of another way?\\n Himeko would make coffee for us...\\n▶ **Firefly:** Coffee... We can\\'t really make that here...\\n▶ **Firefly:** Aren\\'t there... other Crew members we can take inspiration from?\\n Mr. Yang would try to change the subject...\\n▶ **Firefly:** I... have been trying to do that...\\n▶ **Firefly:** ...But I think I failed. Maybe... there are other things that you guys do?\\n March would force us to take a selfie with her...\\n▶ **Firefly:** Selfie, selfie... You\\'re right. I\\'ve been here so many times. Why didn\\'t I think of taking a photo?\\n▶ **Firefly:** I feel a little awkward taking it by myself. Would you like to join me? Let\\'s commemorate this moment.\\n Sure.\\n▶ **Firefly:** I can be a little bit camera\\\\-shy — just don\\'t laugh at me. Here, you hold the camera.\\n I don\\'t think so.\\n▶ **Firefly:** ...Is there a problem?\\n I\\'m kidding.

I never thought you\\'d successfully trigger a conflict between the two.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** As promised, I\\'ve delivered the child to you. Our transaction is complete.\\n What is happening...\\n You two are in this together...\\n Black Swan, you...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Haha, looks like our Nameless friend over here is still confused. Let me explain.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** In short, you need to thank this lady here, my friend. Not only did she not betray you — on the contrary, she rescued you...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...from that \"Galaxy Ranger.\"\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Right, I do enjoy seeing that shocked expression of yours.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** My friend, let\\'s be honest. That woman named \"Acheron\" isn\\'t as simple as you thought. Did she say she\\'s a Galaxy Ranger?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** ...She\\'s actually an Emanator, who brings death and finality.\\n Acheron has her peculiarities, but...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** But? There\\'s no but. This is the truth.\\n An Emanator? Whose?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Perhaps The Hunt... or Destruction... or even Finality. It doesn\\'t matter, these Paths all point to the same outcome.\\n Impossible. Why should I believe you?\\n No way. Acheron was right there at the scene. It couldn\\'t have been her.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** She was there? Wait, what... You\\'re kidding... Oh my, this just got even more interesting.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Let me give you some IPC insider information, my friend. Do you know \"Duke Inferno\" — Fetora\\'s Ifrit?\\n I fought him before.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Nicely done, as expected! I\\'ll cut to the chase then...\\n Who?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** You don\\'t seem to have heard of him before... He belongs to the Annihilation Gang, so I guess it\\'s normal. Then let me explain to you...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** This Duke Inferno is a Fire Demon from Fetora. He\\'s an energy lifeform, and it\\'s rumored that his birth is related to a certain genius...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** He and his thugs formed \"Ever\\\\-Flame Mansion\" and viewed Nanook as their savior — in actuality, they were led by this duke to go around burning and looting, practicing the will of Destruction. And even the other Annihilation Gangs weren\\'t spared.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I\\'m not sure what The Family was thinking, or perhaps someone was scheming behind the scenes, but shockingly these characters received an invitation. And why would the Ever\\\\-Flame Mansion decline? They harbor fierce intentions, swearing to turn the Planet of Festivities into a sea of blazing flames...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** But there\\'s no need to worry. They won\\'t be able to attend. Do you know why?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Because Ifrit is dead.\\n What happened?\\n As I expected...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** They were eliminated while on their way. The assailant, demonstrating remarkable expertise, ruthlessly ended Ifrit and swiped the invite that the Annihilation Gang had in their possession. The Ever\\\\-Flame Mansion disbanded, each going their separate ways...\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Thereafter, a mysterious Galaxy Ranger arrived on Penacony, checking into the hotel with only a music box... Do you still need me to continue the story, my friend?\\n It was Acheron...\\n It doesn\\'t rule out others.\\n Do you have any other evidence?\\n▶ **Aventurine:** The Galaxy Rangers come and go like shadows, and there\\'s little communication between them. Her story is almost too perfect. If she remains silent, there\\'s no concrete evidence against her. While the IPC can investigate, it\\'ll take some time.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** So, my friend, the choice is yours now... You can leave this place immediately, without looking back, and forever forsake the chance to get closer to the truth.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** Or, you can accept my invitation and learn a truth, a truth potent enough to upend everything in Penacony.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** I need your help, so I\\'ll wait — but not for long. Once you are ready... follow me.\\n▶ **Aventurine:** As for aligning with me, see the truth first, then decide... you\\'ll still have time.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (Acheron is the Emanator of a particular Aeon? Can I really believe Aventurine...?)\\n▶ ▶ **(Trailblazer):** (But he gave me a choice...

But... this is also a safe place.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** He needs you. It\\'s essential if we want to reclaim Penacony. Recognizing his immense potential and the invaluable memories he can help me gather, I opted to join forces with him.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** In Penacony, everyone may be lying, and yes... that includes me. I can\\'t deny this, nor do I seek forgiveness.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** But do you still remember? I said... \"I have faith in your potential,\" and that\\'s not a lie.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** The Garden of Recollection wants to witness the future of the Astral Express Trailblazing the cosmos, and as for these memories — I will treasure them. I do not have reasons to hurt any of you. Instead, I will continue to assist you — provided you are willing to accept my assistance.\\n Can I trust Aventurine?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** My take on this might surprise you.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** In my view, he\\'s a trustworthy individual. Not for any other reason, but because he\\'s an exceptional businessman. In this vast universe, no one values honesty and contracts more than a merchant.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** But, always be on guard, particularly when making agreements with him. Scrutinize the details. Beyond the confines of the contract, your rights are off his radar... He\\'ll go to extreme lengths to ensure his advantage.\\n Who do you think is the mastermind...?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** I still believe that Miss Firefly\\'s situation... is deeply connected with the Stellaron Hunter, just as we speculated. But as you\\'ve heard, Aventurine has his finger pointed at the Galaxy Ranger.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** I can\\'t fathom why he\\'d draw that conclusion, but given his access to the IPC\\'s intelligence network, we should seriously consider his perspective. Moreover, I believe Miss Acheron is also hiding something.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** ...No, in fact, I should say, she\\'s hiding everything from us.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** It was an unexpected finding from an earlier encounter. With regards to the Annihilation Gang... I can also prove that what Aventurine said was the truth.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** That\\'s why, during this golden soirée... she is the dance\\'s centerpiece.\\n Are you willing to bring me out of this Memory Zone?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Why of course, but now\\'s not the time.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** I know you\\'re confused and... sad. Whoever that girl might have been, a living soul, a \"memory\" that was meant to last... she simply vanished, like the dissolution of bubbles in water, disappearing in an instant...\\n▶ **Black Swan:** No matter what, I hope you can trust Aventurine — or rather — trust me and see the \"truth\" with your own eyes. This can lead us deeper into the secrets behind Penacony.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** I will protect you. Once I gather more information from him, I\\'ll make sure you\\'re safely returned to your companions.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** For the truth and to prevent more unnecessary sacrifices... It is the right choice.\\n You\\'re right. Let\\'s go.\\n How would I know you\\'re not trying to frame me?\\n▶ **Black Swan:** Perhaps he plans on doing so, but I won\\'t.\\n▶ **Black Swan:** The Garden of Recollection has eyes everywhere. If he wants to hurt you, he\\'ll have to fight against the Memokeepers — I\\'ve warned him about that.\\n▶ ▶ **Black Swan:** Later, I\\'ll stay by your side as a memetic entity, just in case.

There\\'s a new situation in Qlipoth Fort. Going back to find Bronya. Administrative District\\n\\n(Approach designated location)\\n**Bronya:** Welcome back. I appreciate your help more than I can express — it couldn\\'t have been easy running all over the city.\\n**March 7th:** That\\'s what friends are for, Bronya! ...You don\\'t sound like yourself. Is something wrong?\\n**Bronya:** I\\'m fine, I just... I haven\\'t rested in a while. There\\'s just too much happening all at once...\\n I\\'m sure we can turn things around.\\n You couldn\\'t have foreseen all this.\\n**Bronya:** Perhaps, but the IPC won\\'t wait for me to catch up.\\n**Bronya:** They\\'re moving quickly. Belobog is crawling with their agents — all they talk about is \"asset evaluation.\"\\n**Bronya:** The silver lining is that apart from the mine incident you mentioned, there haven\\'t been any major conflicts in other areas. I suppose Topaz must have issued an order against harassing the citizenry.\\n**Bronya:** Still, that hasn\\'t stopped panic from building... People are confused — they don\\'t know where these strangers in black came from, nor what their intentions are.\\n**March 7th:** Did you manage to get in touch with Topaz again? We\\'re curious to know what solution she has in mind...\\n**Bronya:** That\\'s the reason I asked for you to come here. I need your advice.\\n**Bronya:** Look...\\n**March 7th:** It\\'s...\\n**Bronya:** ...The contract Topaz sent to me a little while ago. There\\'s a handwritten letter attached.\\n**Bronya:** Please, take a look at the contents... and then tell me your thoughts.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nMedia:Trailblaze Continuance Future Market (II).mp4   \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n**Topaz:** Miss Bronya — if you\\'ll permit me to call you that — I\\'d like to share a story with you from my own life.\\n**Topaz:** In your eyes, the IPC may seem heartless or cruel, but in reality, we all have a story to tell. As for myself, I was born on a small, unremarkable planet at the edge of the galaxy — a place whose name is known only to the native inhabitants.\\n**Topaz:** My home planet was extremely resource\\\\-poor. To survive, people worked laboriously, manufacturing products for other civilizations in the galaxy — mostly in the chemical or heavy industries.\\n**Topaz:** Given these circumstances, the natural environment of my home planet became increasingly harsh. I don\\'t recall the exact moment when it happened, but people started wearing respirators just to walk down the street. All you could hear were the wheezing coughs of the people — day and night.\\n**Topaz:** My home was facing its demise. The relatively wealthy chose interstellar migration and started anew. The majority who stayed could only struggle on amidst sewage, acid rain, and dust, waiting for the end.\\n**Topaz:** Finally, one fateful day, the IPC arrived on my home planet. They had the technology to repair our planet\\'s damaged environment. In return for their help, they asked for just one thing — that all inhabitants sign a contract which would make them employees of the IPC.\\n**Topaz:** Two years after signing the contract, the dark clouds and haze disappeared, and people began to take off their masks. After three years, vegetation and trees began to grow and thrive again. After five years, many animals — previously on the brink of extinction — reappeared.\\n**Topaz:** When I was finally old enough, I officially became a member of the Strategic Investment Department. I witnessed the changes that took place on my home world and was determined to bring the same changes to many other worlds in the galaxy that were experiencing the same plight.\\n**Topaz:** I am writing to you, Miss Bronya, with the genuine desire to express something important...\\n**Topaz:** I know freedom is precious to people, but in reality there are things of much greater value... such as survival.\\n**Topaz:** How many generations of Belobogians will it take to embrace the stars again without assistance? Who can guarantee that every future Guardian will be as prudent and enlightened as you? How can you guarantee that a disaster such as the Stellaron Crisis will not descend upon Belobog yet again?\\n**Topaz:** I have already negotiated the best possible deal for you. Once you sign this contract, all of Belobog\\'s debts will be forgiven. In addition, the IPC will set up a special team to support the reconstruction of Jarilo\\\\-VI.\\n**Topaz:** I can understand that for you, this is an extremely difficult decision, because you, and you alone will bear the fate of all Belobogians.\\n**Topaz:** But because of this, I believe that you will make the right decision — a decision that will truly benefit your people.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n**March 7th:** Her words do sound quite sincere... What do you make of it, (Trailblazer)?\\n I think so, too.\\n**Bronya:** I\\'m inclined to agree... It\\'s hard to imagine she wrote that letter just to deceive me.\\n She has a way with words.\\n**Bronya:** Yes... she is a high\\\\-ranking member of the IPC, after all. She knows how to use words to her advantage.\\n She\\'s a smooth talker, but that doesn\\'t mean she\\'s telling the truth.\\n**Bronya:** I agree, but it struck me as an honest letter — I found the contents quite moving. It\\'s hard to imagine she\\'d write something like this just to deceive me.\\n**Bronya:** In any case, she wasn\\'t wrong when she said this would be an extremely difficult decision.\\n**Bronya:** This planet\\'s fate, the civilization it carries, everything that has happened here and everything that will happen... it all rests in my hands...\\n**Bronya:** This definitely can\\'t — and shouldn\\'t — be a decision made by me alone.\\n Perhaps you should gain some insight from others first?\\n**Bronya:** That thought has crossed my mind, and it comforts me to hear you say that, (Trailblazer).\\n**March 7th:** Right? I don\\'t think it\\'s fair for you to carry the weight alone. Why not discuss it with others first?\\n I trust your judgment more than anyone else\\'s.\\n**March 7th:** I trust her judgment too, but...\\n**March 7th:** What if this decision is too much for one person? The impact of this choice could haunt Bronya for the rest of her life.\\n**Bronya:** Topaz hasn\\'t given me much time to consider. She wants me to decide as soon as possible.\\n**Bronya:** I wanted to put it to a vote, and let all citizens of both the Overworld and the Underworld have their say. But with such little time, I\\'m afraid that\\'s a lost cause.\\n**Bronya:** I\\'ll convene the Qlipoth Fort Architects immediately to discuss the contract. As for the locals, I\\'d like you to gauge their stance on the matter.\\n**Bronya:** The people of Belobog hold both of you in high regard. They\\'ll most certainly be willing to tell you their thoughts.\\n It\\'s time to race against the clock.\\n**Bronya:** Yes, we need to move fast.\\n Do I have voting rights?\\n**March 7th:** I... think we should leave this matter to the Belobogians... Don\\'t you agree?\\n**March 7th:** We\\'ve got your back! We failed to convince Topaz, but this should be a piece of cake!\\n**Bronya:** Thank you, March. I\\'ll assemble the ministers.

Write down the details first, at least! Administrative District\\n\\n**March 7th:** Alright, if we want to make an informed decision, we need to hear from both the Overworld and the Underworld, right?\\n**March 7th:** Let\\'s start with the Overworld.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Talk to Serval)\\n**Serval:** Well, well, look who we have here! (Trailblazer) and March, paying us a visit. What\\'s the occasion?\\n We need your opinion on an important matter.\\n**Serval:** Uh\\\\-oh, sounds like something serious is happening. You\\'d better fill me in.\\n**You tell Serval about the IPC debt and the choice facing Bronya...**\\n**Serval:** ...What? How is that possible? I need a moment to wrap my head around this...\\n**March 7th:** Serval, we\\'re racing against the clock! No time for head\\\\-wrapping.\\n**Serval:** ...\\n**Serval:** ...It\\'s okay, I\\'ve thought it through... If it were up to me, I\\'d... sign the contract.\\n**March 7th:** What!? Hold on, are you serious? I thought you\\'d be against it for sure!\\n**Serval:** Surprised? My reasons are pretty simple.\\n**Serval:** Signing this contract would mean we no longer have to worry about \"surviving.\" For most of the residents here, especially those in the Underworld, that would be more than enough to persuade them.\\n**Serval:** As for working for the company, pfft, people need to work no matter where they are, right? If the IPC tries to take too many liberties, we can always rise up against them!\\n**Serval:** You know, I\\'ve always longed for the stars since I was a child, which is why I devoted myself to science and the studying of the Stellaron. If someone told me that I could do whatever research I wanted, with only a small price to pay... I probably wouldn\\'t hesitate.\\n**March 7th:** I see... I suppose that makes sense.\\n**March 7th:** Thanks for your input. I\\'ll make a note of your opinion.\\n(Talk to Serval again, optional)\\n**Serval:** I\\'ve always longed for the stars since I was a child, which is why I devoted myself to science and the studying of the Stellaron. If someone told me that I could do whatever research I wanted, with only a small price to pay... I probably wouldn\\'t hesitate.\\n**Serval:** I can\\'t speak for everyone, but this is how I really feel.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Talk to Pela)\\n**Pela:** We meet again! How have you two been?\\n**Pela:** Uh\\\\-oh... That look on (Trailblazer)\\'s face tells me something\\'s wrong. I hope it\\'s nothing too serious.\\n We need your opinion on an important matter.\\n**Pela:** Sounds serious. I\\'m all ears.\\n**You tell Pela about the IPC debt and the choice facing Bronya...**\\n**Pela:** Really...? You better not be making things up!\\n**March 7th:** I wish it were made up... Unfortunately it\\'s all true.\\n**March 7th:** We don\\'t have much time, Pela! Bronya wants to get everyone\\'s opinion.\\n**Pela:** Wait, you\\'re telling me I have to make this huge decision on the spot? At least give me a few seconds to think it over.\\n**Pela:** ...\\n**Pela:** Okay, I think I\\'ve got it.\\n**Pela:** If it were up to me... I\\'d probably agree to the IPC\\'s conditions.\\n**March 7th:** Huh, okay... Any particular reason?\\n**Pela:** I\\'ve looked at some of the climate reports, and based on the data I\\'ve seen, it\\'ll take three or four more generations for the snow to completely subside.\\n**Pela:** And that\\'s assuming no other disasters occur. I care more about those in the present than a future I can\\'t be sure of.\\n**Pela:** If the IPC is able to bring about immediate change, then I think that\\'s a price well worth paying.\\n**Pela:** Building a better world for future generations sound great, right? But is it any fun for the engineers and Architects who are directly involved in such a pursuit?\\n**March 7th:** I see. So compared to a distant and uncertain future, what you really care about is making sure the people around you have a good life...\\n**March 7th:** Thanks for your input. I\\'ll make a note of your opinion.\\n(Talk to Pela again, optional)\\n**Pela:** If the IPC is able to bring about immediate change, then I think that\\'s a price well worth paying.\\n**Pela:** Building a better world for future generations sound great, right? But is it any fun for the engineers and Architects who are directly involved in such a pursuit?\\n**Pela:** I\\'m not sure how much weight my opinion carries, but that\\'s my take on the matter.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Talk to Dunn)\\n**Dunn:** Is that (Trailblazer) and Miss March? It\\'s been a while! I didn\\'t think you\\'d be back in Belobog so soon.\\n**Dunn:** It\\'s been pretty hectic in the city lately. All these people dressed in black suddenly showed up, and even the Silvermane Guards have had trouble dealing with them...\\n We need your opinion on an important matter.\\n**Dunn:** You need my opinion? Happy to help.\\n**You tell Dunn about the IPC debt and the choice facing Bronya...**\\n**Dunn:** ...So that\\'s who they are. Huh, it\\'s worse than I imagined.\\n**Dunn:** The Madam Guardian must be under a lot of pressure... Is there really nothing we can do to assist her?\\n**March 7th:** We\\'re here to gather everyone\\'s opinion on the matter. I know is this a little sudden, but we\\'re running out of time. What\\'s your take?\\n**Dunn:** Why, I\\'d refuse the contract, of course! There is no room for compromise!\\n**Dunn:** Just look at them — arrogant, stomping around here as if they own the place. How can such people be trusted? Who\\'s to say they won\\'t breach the contract?\\n**Dunn:** Faced with this sort of coercion, we must resist them with all our might! Surrendering is not an option!\\n**Dunn:** You must warn the Madam Guardian not to allow herself to fall into their trap!\\n**March 7th:** A soldier\\'s perspective is always valuable, Dunn.\\n**March 7th:** Thanks for your input. I\\'ll make a note of your opinion.\\n(Talk to Dunn again, optional)\\n**Dunn:** Faced with this sort of coercion, we must resist them with all our might! Surrendering is not an option!\\n**Dunn:** You must warn the Madam Guardian not to allow herself to fall into their trap!\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n**March 7th:** Did we miss anyone in the Overworld? I think we asked just about everyone we needed to.\\n**March 7th:** From what I\\'ve gathered, it seems like most people in the Overworld are leaning towards signing the IPC\\'s contract.\\n**March 7th:** We\\'d better hurry to the Underworld and see what Natasha and Seele make of it all...\\n\\n### Compile opinions held by Underworld residents regarding Topaz\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\n(Trailblazer)\\'s Trailblaze Daily Report:  \\nStory leading up to this is too complicated.

Time to go to the Underworld.  \\nPom\\\\-Pom\\'s Notes: What exactly is happening! Write down the details first, at least! Boulder Town\\n\\n(Talk to Natasha)\\n**Natasha:** Miss March, (Trailblazer), what brings you two to the Underworld? And why the long face?\\n We need your opinion on an important matter.\\n**Natasha:** Seems a little out of the blue, but since you came all this way, it must be urgent. Go ahead.\\n**You tell Natasha about the IPC debt and the choice facing Bronya...**\\n**Natasha:** That\\'s a lot of information to take in. Sorry, both of you — I know you\\'re in a hurry, but I need a moment to think.\\n**March 7th:** No stress, Nat. Just tell us what you really think.\\n**Natasha:** ...\\n**Natasha:** I\\'ve thought about it, and... Well, if I were Bronya, I wouldn\\'t sign it.\\n**Natasha:** I won\\'t deny, the offer on the table is a very tempting one... and if we refuse, Belobog will not only have the burden of a huge debt — we may also incite the wrath of a very powerful force...\\n**Natasha:** ...but even so, a quote I read back in school came to me just now: \"Those who are willing to give up freedom for security will end up with neither.\"\\n**Natasha:** Living in the Underworld has taught me that this phrase is true. I\\'d rather trek through the frigid Snow Plains than live in a beautiful cage.\\n**March 7th:** ...Wow, that\\'s a pretty convincing argument...\\n**March 7th:** Another vote for the against pile. Thanks for your insight, Nat.\\n(Talk to Natasha again, optional)\\n**Natasha:** \"Those who are willing to give up freedom for security will end up with neither.\"\\n**Natasha:** I hope Bronya takes these words seriously.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Talk to Clara)\\n**Clara:** Miss March, (big brother/big sister) (Trailblazer)! What brings you to the Underworld?\\n**March 7th:** Hey there, Clara! Huh? Is Svarog not around?\\n**Clara:** Mr. Svarog went out for a walk with a lady called Topaz...\\n**March 7th:** What!? Topaz!? Do you know where they went?\\n**Clara:** I\\'m not sure... but Mr. Svarog promised he\\'d be back soon...\\n**March 7th:** Ugh! What now, (Trailblazer)? Svarog\\'s super logical, we should definitely get his opinion...\\n At least Clara\\'s here.\\n Clara\\'s opinion is just as important!\\n**March 7th:** True. Dan Heng\\'s always saying that Clara\\'s really insightful for her age.\\n**Clara:** Huh? Miss March, do you want to ask me something?\\n**You tell Clara about the IPC debt and the choice facing Bronya...**\\n**Clara:** ...\\n**Clara:** Uhh... That\\'s complicated... I don\\'t know what to say...\\n**March 7th:** It\\'s alright, Clara, no pressure. Just tell us how you feel about it.\\n**Clara:** ...\\n**Clara:** I... I think if we have a choice for the future, it should be everyone\\'s decision.\\n**Clara:** Because... when I was playing with Hook, The Moles, and the other kids... We talked about our dreams...\\n**Clara:** Everyone has different dreams. If we accept Miss Topaz\\'s offer, then doesn\\'t that mean our dreams will never come true?\\n**Clara:** Just taking away people\\'s dreams like that... I don\\'t know... It feels wrong.\\n**March 7th:** You\\'re right. Children see the world as a place where anything is possible...\\n**March 7th:** ...just the thought of our lives being predestined from birth makes me shiver!\\n**March 7th:** Thanks, Clara. Your thoughts mean a lot to us.\\n(Talk to Clara again, optional)\\n**Clara:** I think if we have a choice for the future, it should be everyone\\'s decision.\\n**Clara:** Hook, Julian and The Moles all have different dreams. I don\\'t think anyone should take them away.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Talk to Oleg)\\n**Oleg:** None other than the saviors of Belobog! To what do I owe the pleasure? To be honest, I\\'m surprised you even remembered an old geezer like me!\\n**Oleg:** But... I can tell by the look on your faces you\\'re probably not dropping by to say hi.\\n We need your opinion on an important matter.\\n**Oleg:** Let me guess — something to do with these unruly people in black showing up everywhere?\\n**Oleg:** Well, ask away! It just so happens I\\'m curious about them myself. Maybe I can be of some help.\\n**You tell Oleg about the IPC debt and the choice facing Bronya...**\\n**Oleg:** I see...\\n**Oleg:** ...That\\'s a tricky situation alright... a lot for anyone to handle, let alone someone as young as Lady Bronya.\\n**March 7th:** Mr. Oleg, out of all the people we know in Belobog, you have the most life experience. What do you think we should do?\\n**Oleg:** Wanna hear the truth? I\\'m afraid great ambitions and lofty plans no longer hold much appeal for an old\\\\-timer like me.\\n**Oleg:** If this \"IPC\" does indeed possess the magical power to restore Belobog back to its former self overnight, then I think the answer is clear.\\n**Oleg:** Have you considered the opposite? What about if we refuse? The reconstruction plan already sounds like an endless endeavor. With the added burden of a massive debt... How\\'s that something we can manage on our own?\\n**Oleg:** What worries me most is how Lady Bronya will handle the backlash from her people. Will she be able to withstand the criticism? Is she prepared to carry the weight of a tarnished reputation for years to come?\\n Bronya... \"The Last Supreme Guardian...\"\\n**March 7th:** Huh, I guess I never looked at it from that angle... I wouldn\\'t wish that title on anyone.\\n I think she can handle a little criticism.\\n**March 7th:** I think so too. But could you imagine having to hear names like \"The Traitorous Ruler\" for the rest of your life?\\n**March 7th:** Thank you for your thoughts, Mr. Oleg. Another vote for the \"for\" pile.\\n(Talk to Oleg again, optional)\\n**Oleg:** The truth is, great ambitions and lofty plans no longer hold much appeal for an old\\\\-timer like me.\\n**Oleg:** If this \"IPC\" does indeed possess the magical power to restore Belobog back to its former self overnight, then I think the answer is clear.\\n**Oleg:** But that\\'s just my personal opinion. In the end, it\\'s all up to Lady Bronya.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n**After collecting more citizen opinions, the final result remains a tie...**\\n**March 7th:** Whew... All that running around has worn me out.\\n**March 7th:** So, the final conclusion is...\\n**March 7th:** ...The votes are completely even! Ugh, I don\\'t know what to do — both sides have really compelling arguments.\\n There\\'s still one person left to ask.\\n**March 7th:** Right! We haven\\'t asked Seele!\\n Only Bronya can make the final call.\\n**March 7th:** Wait a minute, we forgot to ask Seele! Let\\'s go see what she has to say.\\n**March 7th:** She\\'s probably still in the Great Mine helping the miners. Come on, let\\'s get going!\\n\\n### Head to the Great Mine and ask Seele about what she thinks\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\n(Trailblazer)\\'s Trailblaze Daily Report:  \\nFinished collecting ideas. It\\'s a split vote. Oh well, let\\'s find Seele and get her to decide. Great Mine\\n\\n(Talk to Seele)\\n**Seele:** Back so soon? Any news?\\n**Seele:** A\\\\-are you feeling alright, (Trailblazer)? You look a little uneasy.\\n We need your opinion on an important matter.\\n**Seele:** Important matter, huh...?\\n**Seele:** I can tell from your tone this isn\\'t gonna be a lighthearted chat... but I\\'m ready to hear it.\\n**You tell Seele about the IPC debt and the choice facing Bronya...**\\n**Seele:** ...\\n**Seele:** I... think I get it. At first, I thought it was just a few IPC ruffians overstepping their boundaries...\\n**March 7th:** Yeah, you didn\\'t think the future of Belobog was at stake, right?\\n**Seele:** Right... I need a little time to process this...\\n**March 7th:** As it stands, the votes are even. Your opinion will make all the difference.\\n**Seele:** ...\\n**Seele:** ...In that case... I... I abstain.\\n**March 7th:** Huh?!\\n Your vote is extremely important...\\n**Seele:** I\\'ve thought about it... This responsibility rests on Bronya\\'s shoulders, not mine.\\n You have to shoulder this responsibility.\\n**Seele:** No, this responsibility rests on Bronya\\'s shoulders, not mine.\\n**Seele:** No matter the choice she makes, she has far greater foresight than I do — she can see the bigger picture more clearly than I can.\\n**Seele:** The vote is tied. If I were to give you my view, it would tip the scales and possibly impact her final choice.\\n**Seele:** I\\'ll respect whatever decision she makes, but... it\\'s not my place to make it for her.\\n**March 7th:** ...Understood, Seele. This is a difficult decision to make, and everyone feels differently about it.\\n**March 7th:** It\\'s times like these that a leader must stand up and do what\\'s needed...\\n**Seele:** Right... It\\'s Bronya\\'s decision. She knows what\\'s at stake — she won\\'t run away from her duty. I trust her wholeheartedly.\\n**Seele:** If she asks you, just let her know my reasoning. She\\'ll understand.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n**March 7th:** Well, it\\'s all in Bronya\\'s hands now. She has to make the final call.\\n She plays a crucial role on this world.\\n**March 7th:** Right? I\\'m glad Belobog has someone like her in charge...\\n Do you trust her judgment?\\n**March 7th:** You bet! The Express can vouch for Bronya. That says a lot about her character.\\n**March 7th:** The time has come — let\\'s go fill her in. I\\'m curious to see how she\\'s handling those Qlipoth ministers.\\n\\n### Return to Qlipoth Fort and report to Bronya\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\n(Trailblazer)\\'s Trailblaze Daily Report:  \\nStill a split vote. The pressure is now on Bronya. Should go back and report to her. Great Mine\\n\\n**March 7th:** Whoa, the fort\\'s packed... I\\'ve never seen this many people here before.\\n**March 7th:** Geez... I can barely even hear myself think!\\n(Talk to Bronya)\\n**Bronya:** March, (Trailblazer), you\\'re back.\\n**Bronya:** So... what\\'s the verdict? What do the people think?\\n**March 7th:** We talked to people in both the Overworld and Underworld. The final result was... a tie.\\n**Bronya:** I see... I suppose everyone has their own way of seeing things. I can\\'t say I\\'m surprised.\\n**Bronya:** ...What was Seele\\'s perspective on the matter?\\n She\\'s behind you, whatever you decide.\\n She thought it wasn\\'t her place to say.\\n**Bronya:** ...I should\\'ve known. That sounds like Seele alright.\\n**March 7th:** Did you come to a conclusion with the ministers? It\\'s so loud I can\\'t tell what anyone\\'s saying...\\n**Bronya:** It\\'s pretty much the same situation here. Neither party is willing to compromise.\\n**Bronya:** The time has to come to make a decision... This chaos cannot be allowed to continue any longer.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Cutscene plays)\\n\\n**Bronya:** Enough!\\n**Bronya:** All of you!\\n**Bronya:** ...I know what to do.\\n**Himeko:** Wait!\\n**Himeko:** I have something to say to the Supreme Guardian.\\n(Cutscene ends)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n**Bronya:** But... aren\\'t you—?\\n**March 7th:** Himeko! Wait, is that the real you or a hologram!?\\n**Himeko:** Haha, it\\'s the real me, March — real as they come.\\n**Bronya:** Miss Himeko? From the Astral Express? I—It\\'s an honor — thank you for all your help in our previous... campaign. Things might have turned out differently without your support.\\n**Bronya:** If we\\'d known of your arrival beforehand, the Architects would have given you a proper welcome. I\\'m afraid the current circumstances are quite exceptional...\\n**Himeko:** I understand, Miss Bronya — no need to explain. Your city is facing immense difficulties — my intention is simply to ensure that you have all the relevant intel.\\n Do you have a solution, Himeko?\\n**Himeko:** I hesitate to call it a solution, but I have some information that might help.\\n**Himeko:** It is my hope that with this information, you will be better equipped as the supreme guardian to make a wise and informed decision.\\n Couldn\\'t you have come a bit sooner?\\n**Himeko:** The life of a navigator is a busy one, (Trailblazer). You should be glad that I made it in time.\\n**Himeko:** There is some important information that I must pass on to you, Supreme Guardian. It is my hope that it will better equip you to make a wise and informed decision.\\n**Bronya:** Information? Please, tell me what you know, Miss Himeko.\\n**Himeko:** I happen to have a friend with knowledge of Topaz. What Topaz said about her homeworld is indeed true... which is why she believes that the IPC\\'s takeover of Belobog is the only way of ensuring the city\\'s survival...\\n**Himeko:** ...but there is one thing she intentionally left out: Not all worlds that have accepted the IPC\\'s terms have been saved.\\n**Bronya:** You mean...\\n**Himeko:** Performing \"ecological reconstruction\" on a planet carries inevitable risks.\\n**Himeko:** According to the intel provided by my friend, the success rate for the ecological reconstruction of worlds using the IPC\\'s technology is 63%.\\n**March 7th:** Only 63% of planets succeed? That\\'s not exactly comforting...\\n**Himeko:** This is the overall average across all IPC projects. The success rate of projects personally handled by Topaz is above 80%. She\\'s undoubtedly one of the most capable people in her field.\\n**Himeko:** I wanted to bring these numbers, these \"probabilities\" to light. I think it\\'s only fair that you know all the facts before making a decision.\\n**Himeko:** Ultimately, it\\'s up to you, Supreme Guardian, to make the final call.\\n**Bronya:** I understand... Thank you, Miss Himeko. This information is of great help.\\n**Bronya:** Regardless of how alluring their promises may be, this contract is nothing more than a gamble. As leader, I cannot let the future of Belobog hinge on a roll of the dice.\\n**Himeko:** Now that you\\'ve decided, I don\\'t have to pretend to be impartial anymore. I think you\\'re making the right choice, Bronya.\\n**Bronya:** Astral friends, I have an idea. But for it to work, I\\'ll need everyone\\'s cooperation.\\n**Bronya:** I need some time to rally all the residents in the city... and then I\\'ll meet with Topaz again.\\n**Bronya:** Please locate her for me. It doesn\\'t matter where she is or what she\\'s doing. And if the IPC is still trying to take over Belobog\\'s assets, I ask that you do everything in your power to stop them.\\n**Himeko:** Don\\'t worry, leave it to us — we\\'ll find her. It won\\'t be easy dealing with her, but March and (Trailblazer) will help me get the job done.\\n**Bronya:** Belobog\\'s future is not for sale, and we\\'ll never forget the friends who stood by us in our time of need — not once, but twice.\\n**Bronya:** Stay safe, everyone.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nMessages  \\nGroup chat with Bronya, Gepard, (Trailblazer) and othersBronyaWe can talk here, GepardAnd share your reports with the CrewGepardYes, Lady BronyaThe more details, the better(Trailblazer)The more details, the betterDid you have a fight?(Trailblazer)Did you have a fight?GepardThe Supreme Guardian ordered me to garrison in Rivet Town with Silvermane Guards and automatons to stop the IPC\\'s infiltration.The defense went smoothly at first, but then Topaz herself appeared with some special technology that allowed her to seize control of all our automatons in an instant.It seems Topaz is heading for a certain area in the depths of Rivet Town.

I never would\\'ve guessed it\\'d be here.\\n**Topaz:** But I don\\'t see any mech or weapons... This place is completely surrounded by mountains — surely they can\\'t be...\\n**Svarog:** Affirmative. The weapons are concealed within the towering rock formations.\\n**Topaz:** No wonder we couldn\\'t find the \"automaton factory.\" It was right under our noses all along.\\n**Topaz:** ...Wait a minute, you said these weapons have been hidden here from the very beginning? That means the Architects of Jarilo\\\\-VI never used them in their fight against the Legion.\\n**Svarog:** Correct. After the IPC departed from this world more than 700 years ago, no one has possessed the necessary knowledge for activating these weapons.\\n**Svarog:** The Architects used the IPC blueprints to construct replica automatons. However, the overwhelming majority of the combatants, commanded by Alisa Rand, were human.\\n**Topaz:** I see... The stories about this world are truly captivating.\\n**Svarog:** I would like to ask you a question, Topaz.\\n**Topaz:** Haha, you\\'re awful polite for a big robot. Ask! Don\\'t be shy!\\n**Svarog:** \"If the IPC does not intervene, this world is doomed.\" Are you convinced of this conclusion beyond any doubt?\\n**Topaz:** ...\\n**Topaz:** Yes. I\\'ve gone through countless case studies and they all point to the same conclusion: Any world that comes into contact with a Stellaron is doomed.\\n**Topaz:** On the surface, things may appear to be getting better since the Astral Express lent a helping hand, but sooner or later the underlying problems will resurface.\\n**Topaz:** A looming crisis can often lie hidden beneath the illusion of prosperity, unnoticed by many.\\n**Svarog:** Understood.\\n**Topaz:** \"Understood...\" That\\'s it? You don\\'t have any thoughts on the matter?\\n**Svarog:** Emotional readings indicate that your response is sincere and accurate. That is all I wish to confirm regarding this matter.\\n**Svarog:** While my opinion on the future of this planet may differ from yours, it ultimately holds no weight.

Use the Automaton Stealth Bomb to wipe out the IPC threats.\\n Ready.\\n**Gepard:** Remember, try to avoid being noticed. Remaining hidden will increase our chances of success.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(If you got noticed)\\n**March 7th:** Oh no, they saw right through it...\\n**Gepard:** It\\'s alright — we prepared many backups. Try again.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(On success)\\n**March 7th:** Woohoo! The coast is clear!\\n**Gepard:** To be honest, I didn\\'t think it would be so powerful...

Topaz is here.  \\nNeed to stop her no matter what she is planning.  \\nPom\\\\-Pom\\'s Notes: What kinda place is \"weird place\"? At least describe it! Rivet Town\\n\\n(Approach Svarog)\\n**March 7th:** Mr Svarog! Are you alright? I hope Topaz and her IPC henchmen didn\\'t hurt you.\\n**Svarog:** Greetings, outsiders. System functions are normal — I have had no conflict with the IPC\\'s representatives.\\n I thought we might be facing off against each other for a moment.\\n**Svarog:** Such a result would be highly undesirable.\\n**Svarog:** Topaz is ahead. She had the means to force me to comply with her orders, but chose not to.\\n**Svarog:** From her perspective, the only way to \"preserve\" Belobog is by incorporating it into the IPC. While I do not agree with her viewpoint, I lack the computational power to provide evidence to the contrary.\\n**Svarog:** While it is unlikely, I still encourage the avoidance of any potential conflicts.\\n**March 7th:** \"Unlikely, potential...\" meaning there could still be conflicts...\\n**Himeko:** Don\\'t worry, March. The Express never pursues conflict as a first means... but if it comes down to it, we won\\'t back down either. That\\'s how it\\'s always been.\\n**March 7th:** Himeko\\'s right. As long as we can look at ourselves in the mirror and know we did the right thing, that\\'s all that matters.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Approach marker)\\n**March 7th:** Why would Topaz come here? Is she looking for something?\\n**Himeko:** It\\'s possible. Many mysteries lurk beneath the surface of this world.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Approach Topaz)\\n**Topaz:** Oh, hey there slowpokes! I was starting to think you weren\\'t gonna show up.\\n**Topaz:** Hmm... This lady next to Miss March looks oddly familiar.\\n**Himeko:** Pleasure to meet you, Miss Topaz. I\\'m Himeko, the Astral Express\\' navigator.\\n**Topaz:** Oh wow, I remember now, the illustrious Miss Himeko! Some of my colleagues dream about meeting you!\\n Himeko is that famous?\\n**Topaz:** Of course! The Nameless have quite the reputation — you\\'re following in the footsteps of the great Akivili, after all!\\n Do I have any fans?\\n**Topaz:** I\\'d be surprised if you didn\\'t! Don\\'t underestimate the reputation of the Nameless out among the stars — you\\'re following in the footsteps of the great Akivili, after all!\\n**Himeko:** I\\'m pleased to see how well everyone\\'s been getting along. Topaz, based on your greeting I presume you have a good grasp of the current situation?\\n**Topaz:** Of course! The deadline has already passed, but Bronya still hasn\\'t signed the contract. I think I can guess what\\'s holding her back...\\n**Himeko:** Please don\\'t misunderstand us, Miss Topaz. We have no intention of opposing the IPC or its board of directors... but we have very dear friends on Jarilo\\\\-VI.\\n**Himeko:** Standing idly by and watching them sign an unfair contract... goes against everything the Nameless are about.\\n**March 7th:** Um... Miss Himeko, sorry for interrupting, but this doesn\\'t sound like a negotiation...\\n**Himeko:** We needn\\'t waste our time, March. She made her decision ten minutes ago.\\n**Topaz:** Haha, there\\'s no fooling the Astral Express!\\n**Topaz:** You\\'re absolutely right. Differing views don\\'t necessarily mean one person is right and the other is wrong. However, to keep things moving forward, there\\'s usually only one solution...\\n**March 7th:** Huh? Wh—What do you mean?\\n**Topaz:** My superiors have granted me the approval I need.\\n Approval for what?\\n**Topaz:** You\\'re very curious about my work, aren\\'t you?\\n Your vacation time has been approved?\\n**Topaz:** Haha, I wish!\\n**Topaz:** So many eager faces — I won\\'t keep you in the dark any longer.\\n**Topaz:** Approval to launch an attack on the members of the Astral Express...\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Cutscene plays)\\n\\n**Topaz:** The best\\\\-kept secret to getting something over the line?\\n**Topaz:** Always be ready to turn the tables.\\n**Topaz:** Go, Numby!\\n**Topaz:** Projects under my wing... have no room for error!\\n(Begin battle against  Grunt: Field Personnel ×1,  Grunt: Security Personnel ×1,  Automaton Hound ×1, )\\n(Wave 2  Grunt: Field Personnel ×2,  Grunt: Security Personnel ×2)\\n(Wave 3  Senior Staff: Team Leader ×1,  Grunt: Field Personnel ×1,  Grunt: Security Personnel ×1)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n**Topaz:** Incredible!

You\\'re here just in time! Things were about to get out of control!\\n**Topaz:** Supreme Guardian? I was starting to wonder whether you\\'d left the Express crew to fend for themselves! That would hardly be becoming of you.\\n**Bronya:** I would never do such a thing. There was an important matter that required my attention.\\n**Topaz:** ...MORE important than this?\\n**Bronya:** Yes. I think you\\'ll understand the significance once you see it... In short, I need you to help us evaluate our current progress.\\n**Topaz:** ...Help you? Hmm, that\\'s interesting. I was under the impression you\\'d already decided to obstruct our operations here.\\n**Bronya:** I have read your letter word for word, Miss Topaz, and your childhood experiences truly touched me.\\n**Bronya:** Your hometown once experienced a similar catastrophe to Jarilo\\\\-VI, so I can understand your perspective on the issue and the position you have taken.\\n**Bronya:** It\\'s because of this empathy you have, that I still hold out a glimmer of hope. Despite all that\\'s happened, I hope we can still find common ground... through peaceful means.\\n**Topaz:** ...I have to admit, talking to you is always such a pleasure. I apologize for my behavior just now, it was... inappropriate.\\n**Topaz:** I admire your determination. Seeing as we\\'ve come this far... I\\'ve changed my mind — I\\'ll hold off a little longer and see what you have to show me. But remember — winning over the higher\\\\-ups won\\'t be easy.\\n**Bronya:** I understand. That\\'s why I\\'ve been taking things one step at a time. The first step was changing your mind.\\n**Bronya:** Members of the Express, we\\'ll need your help, too.\\n(Challenge completed)\\n\\n(Obtain  Traveler\\'s Guide ×4,  Lost Crystal ×4, and  Credit ×40,000)\\n\\n### Head to the Corridor of Fading Echoes and see where Bronya wants to take you\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\n(Trailblazer)\\'s Trailblaze Daily Report:  \\nAlmost fought with Topaz. Thankfully, Bronya came to stop us. She said she\\'ll take us to a place. Curious. Corridor of Fading Echoes\\n\\n**Topaz:** What a dismal sight. This district... Have you been here before?\\n**Bronya:** Yes... This is where we put an end to it all...\\n**Himeko:** ...And then began again.\\n**Bronya:** That\\'s right.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Talk to Silvermane Soldier)\\n**Bronya:** Kyle, sorry for the delay. Are we clear to proceed?\\n**Soldier Kyle:** The path ahead is clear, Madam Guardian. You and your companions can proceed north without hindrance.\\n**Bronya:** Excellent. The mountain road ahead is a little treacherous, watch your step.\\n**Bronya:** ...Let\\'s go.\\n\\n### Follow the path to the Pillars of Creation\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\n(Trailblazer)\\'s Trailblaze Daily Report:  \\nBronya took us to a new place. It\\'s even more up north than Everwinter Hill. Wanna see what\\'s up ahead. Pillars of Creation\\n\\n**March 7th:** ...What is this place? We\\'ve never been here before, right?\\n**Bronya:** Mm, we\\'ve only recently discovered this domain.\\n**Bronya:** Let\\'s keep moving forward. What I want to show you is just ahead.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Cutscene plays)\\n\\n**Bronya:** Look,\\n**Bronya:** The people of Belobog have not given up...\\n**Bronya:** ... I just want to give them a chance.\\n(Cutscene ends)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n**Bronya:** ...Do you two recognize that broken\\\\-down machine over there?\\n The Engine of Creation...\\n**Bronya:** I thought you might.\\n It\\'s Cocolia\\'s...\\n**March 7th:** Hey! Shh! That\\'s a secret!\\n**Bronya:** It\\'s called the Engine of Creation. Do you remember it?\\n**Bronya:** Miss Topaz, I know you\\'ve done a lot of research into Belobog. I was wondering if there was any information on the Engine of Creation in your records?\\n**Topaz:** Not at all... which is why I find it so incredible... Such a massive feat of engineering, yet there\\'s not a single mention of it in any of the Strategic Investment Department\\'s reports.\\n**Bronya:** I may know the reason why. The Engine of Creation was constructed solely by the people of Belobog, without any external assistance.\\n**Bronya:** The project was led by the first Supreme Guardian — Alisa Rand. While warriors fought on the front lines, the engineers worked tirelessly behind the scenes, designing and constructing it...\\n**Topaz:** So what you\\'re saying is... the \"Engine of Creation\" was a weapon constructed by the Belobogians themselves?\\n**Bronya:** Yes, but not entirely.\\n**Bronya:** The Engine of Creation was commissioned for combat shortly after its completion and played a significant role in the battles against the Legion.\\n**Bronya:** But Alisa Rand had a long\\\\-term vision, one that nobody anticipated. For a long time, this feat of engineering was codenamed the \"Geological Reconstruction Unit.\"\\n**Bronya:** It was actually given a much grander purpose: to help the Belobogians rebuild their homeland and restore their world to its former glory... after driving away all those who threatened it.\\n**Topaz:** Remarkable. A vision that would transcend both time and generations of Belobogians. Madam Rand was truly an inspiring leader.\\n**Topaz:** Not to take away from the Supreme Guardian in front of me... Hehe, she\\'s quite the inspiring leader as well.\\n**Bronya:** Thank you, but I didn\\'t really do anything.\\n**Bronya:** All I did was bring the people of Belobog together and make them aware that our hard\\\\-earned freedom was under immense threat once again.\\n**Bronya:** If we want to preserve this freedom, we must act and show those who doubt us that we, Belobog, have the will and the ability to control our own destiny.\\n**Bronya:** The outcome of our mobilization speaks for itself. The children of Belobog have made their decision. They have chosen to preserve this homeland with their own two hands.\\n**Topaz:** ...I must say, I didn\\'t anticipate this at all.\\n**Topaz:** ...\\n**Topaz:** I\\'ll fight for this opportunity for you, Bronya. I shouldn\\'t have conflated your own circumstances with my childhood. That was a serious lapse of judgment on my part.\\n**Topaz:** My world never had a resolute leader, so people gave up on the idea of saving themselves long ago. But your civilization has persisted through the snow and storms for 700 years... A truly admirable feat.\\n**Bronya:** Then, are you willing to retract your previous decision? As for the debt... we\\'ll find a way to gradually repay it, but it\\'ll take some time...\\n**Topaz:** ...Unfortunately the acquisition of Jarilo\\\\-VI is a strategic decision that\\'s been approved by the IPC\\'s top brass. Even if I wanted to overturn it, convincing them would be extremely difficult.\\n**Topaz:** Unless...\\n**Himeko:** Don\\'t worry, Miss Topaz. Myself and all of the Nameless aboard the Astral Express are willing to vouch for this world.\\n**Topaz:** Fantastic! That might just work. As for the reports and potential accountability...\\n**Topaz:** ...I\\'ll handle it.\\n\\n### Talk to Bronya and Topaz\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\n(Trailblazer)\\'s Trailblaze Daily Report:  \\nHappy end. Everyone has a bright future. Perfection.  \\nPom\\\\-Pom\\'s Notes: Never mind... I\\'m gonna go read Himeko\\'s daily report... Pillars of Creation\\n\\n(Talk to Bronya)\\n**Bronya:** Miss Topaz, you mentioned accountability...\\n**Topaz:** Don\\'t worry, it\\'s nothing I can\\'t handle. There are more important things than titles and ranks — finding the best solution is what matters most.\\n Will they cut your pay?\\n**Topaz:** If that\\'s what they want to do, then so be it. I\\'ve long passed the stage of working just for money.\\n Won\\'t you get fired?\\n**Topaz:** Haha, that\\'s unlikely. At most, they might lower my rank and reduce my bonus a bit. But don\\'t worry, I work for far more than just a paycheck.\\n**Bronya:** Thank you so much for all you\\'ve done, (Trailblazer). I never thought we\\'d drag the Express into a crisis again, much less one that might cause a rift between you and the IPC.\\n**Topaz:** A rift? I wouldn\\'t go that far. Also, it\\'s me who\\'s mostly to blame — I didn\\'t keep my subordinates in check.\\n Mind putting in some good words for me with your bosses?\\n**Topaz:** Oh? Thinking about a career change?\\n**Topaz:** Sure thing! I\\'ll put in the best words I can, (Trailblazer).\\n Is it true the IPC requires you to go through 17 rounds of interviews?\\n**Topaz:** 17? Oh... I think I might know who you\\'re talking about.\\n**Topaz:** You could say he\\'s a special case. For most people the interview process is much shorter.\\n**Bronya:** Hehe, I\\'m glad we\\'re able to discuss some lighter topics.\\n**Bronya:** (Trailblazer), you all need some rest after everything you\\'ve been through. I\\'ve arranged rooms for you all at the Goethe Hotel.\\n**Bronya:** Miss Topaz, if you need somewhere comfortable to stay...\\n**Topaz:** I appreciate the offer, but I need to head back and deliver my reports.\\n**Topaz:** (Trailblazer), Miss Bronya, it\\'s been great getting to know you both. I hope we can work together again in the future... only next time under better circumstances!\\n(If you talk to Bronya again)\\n**Bronya:** (Trailblazer), why don\\'t you head over to the Goethe Hotel and relax for a bit? Miss Topaz and I still have a few matters to discuss.\\n**Bronya:** I\\'m sorry you didn\\'t get to experience the festival atmosphere this time around... I promise I\\'ll make it up to you all next time.\\n(Talk to March 7th, optional)\\n**March 7th:** Phew, I was worried things were gonna get ugly again. A peaceful solution is always the best solution.\\n**March 7th:** Speaking of solutions... Are they repairing that giant robot — the one we fought against? I remember you took control of it and helped us defeat Cocolia!\\n I wonder if we\\'ll have time to celebrate the Solwarm Festival.\\n**March 7th:** Right! I\\'d totally forgotten — that\\'s the whole reason we came here in the first place!\\n**March 7th:** Looks like everyone in the city\\'s helping with construction — doubt there\\'ll be much time for celebrating. Still, look on the bright side — we got to meet a top IPC executive! The trip wasn\\'t a complete waste, right?\\n I hope Topaz\\'s negotiations go smoothly.\\n**March 7th:** Miss Topaz is definitely up to the job! She has that aura of... what\\'s the word... invincibility!\\n**March 7th:** Well, we didn\\'t get to enjoy the festivities this time round, but at least we still got to meet a top IPC executive!\\n(Talk to Himeko, optional)\\n**Himeko:** Y\\'know, (Trailblazer), I\\'d heard you and March speak highly of the Supreme Guardian before, but seeing her methods firsthand left me in awe.\\n**Himeko:** We should also be glad that Miss Topaz is the one in charge of the Jarilo\\\\-VI project. If it were someone else from the Strategic Investment Department, things might have gotten... complicated.\\n What do you mean, Himeko?\\n**Himeko:** The Strategic Investment Department comprises the IPC\\'s most elite employees, many of whom can be very... forceful.\\n You mean Topaz didn\\'t make things complicated enough?\\n**Himeko:** That tells me you really don\\'t understand the Strategic Investment Department, (Trailblazer).\\n**Himeko:** Let\\'s talk about this later when you\\'re back on the Express. You and March must be tired after such an incredible journey — it\\'s time you got some well\\\\-deserved rest.\\n(Upon nearing the bridge)\\n**Mechanic:** This bridge is structurally unstable, please stay clear until repairs are complete.\\n\\n### Head to Goethe Hotel for a good night\\'s sleep\\\\[]\\n\\n\\n **Step Description**\\n\\n---\\n\\n(Trailblazer)\\'s Trailblaze Daily Report:  \\nHappy end.

Administrative District\\n\\n(Enter Goethe Hotel)\\n**March 7th:** I\\'ve been wondering, how did you figure out what was happening here on Belobog, Himeko?\\n**Himeko:** Well, you know, keeping an eye on the crew is just another part of a navigator\\'s job.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Rest)\\n**(Trailblazer):** (March was looking forward to the Solwarm Festival for ages... Looks like she\\'s missed her chance, this time...)\\n**(Trailblazer):** (I never thought this trip would be so... \\\\*yawn\\\\* ...tiring.

All bonuses for the current cycle will be revoked, including stock options and performance bonuses.\\n**???:** You will also need to submit an additional report regarding this incident to Diamond. If you have any objections to this penalty, you may also file an appeal in writing.\\n**Topaz:** I have no objections.\\n**???:** Understood. Is there anything else anyone would like to add?\\n...\\n**???:** If there are no further remarks, this meeting is concluded.\\n**Topaz:** ...\\n**???:** You only got demoted one rank? Whew, you dodged a bullet there — pretty big project to mess up on. Someone must be looking out for you. Oh, they\\'ve already left the call...\\n**???:** Ugh, this voice changer is driving me crazy. Let me turn it off.\\n**Topaz:** ...Aventurine? Why are you still on the line?\\n**Aventurine:** Hey, what\\'s with the hostility? It\\'s not like I\\'m your boss... Oh, wait, I guess I am now? Haha! My apologies — I\\'m still getting used to my new place in the hierarchy!\\n**Topaz:** ...Can I help you? If you\\'ve got something to say, say it already.\\n**Aventurine:** Oh, nothing important — just checking in on you. I told you Jarilo\\\\-VI would be a high\\\\-risk low\\\\-reward case. Why\\'d you even bother?\\n**Aventurine:** In our line of work, having a kind heart can be more of a liability than an asset. If you\\'re not careful, you\\'ll end up leading yourself down a dead\\\\-end road...\\n**Topaz:** ...Anything else? If not, I\\'m hanging up.\\n**Aventurine:** W—Wait, hold on a minute, don\\'t hang up. I get it, you\\'re not in the mood for this conversation right now... Okay, how about this — something that might interest you...\\n**Aventurine:** While you were enjoying your playtime on Jarilo\\\\-VI, Diamond was busy taking care of the head honcho of the Building Material Logistics Department. That\\'s why he didn\\'t attend today\\'s meeting.\\n**Topaz:** Taravan?\\n**Aventurine:** That\\'s right, the renowned Taravan — one of the seven board members! He\\'s throwing his support behind us instead of the Marketing Development Department for once. Ha! Oswaldo won\\'t be laughing anymore!\\n**Aventurine:** Diamond\\'s been a great help to both of us. Your antics on such a crucial day can\\'t exactly have painted the Strategic Investment Department in a good light, y\\'know?\\n**Topaz:** ...\\n**Aventurine:** Since you get the point, let\\'s get down to business... I\\'m currently at Pier Point — there\\'s a major deal that could affect the whole department. I just so happen to need a reliable project manager for the job... what do you say, old friend?\\n**Topaz:** Huh, and what prompted the mighty Aventurine to start collaborating with others?\\n**Aventurine:** Penacony, what else?\\n**Topaz:** ...What?\\n**Aventurine:** That\\'s right⁓ Now that\\'s the kind of reaction I was hoping for.\\n**Topaz:** Hold on a minute... Diamond picked you for this project? I was expecting someone like Opal or Obsidian to handle it — at least somebody higher than rank P46\\\\...\\n**Aventurine:** Honestly, who knows? \"The Family\" has some pretty questionable characters. If you ask me, doing business with them is a lost cause.\\n**Aventurine:** But as we both know, the IPC does more than just \"business deals\" — guess it\\'s my time to shine. So, how about it? This is a rare opportunity. Consider it. You never know, you might even be able to make up for your blunder on Jarilo\\\\-VI.\\n**Topaz:** ...\\n**Topaz:** ...I\\'ll get back to you later.\\n**Topaz:** ...Seems it\\'s just one wild ride after another...\\n**Topaz:** ...but I hope I made the right decision this time...\\n**Topaz:** This snow is mesmerizing...\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n(Mission completed)\\n\\n(Obtain Achievement Sunny Deeds Beget Rainy Needs)\\n(Visitor Verification)\\n\\n(Topaz and Numby has become a visitor to the Express.
